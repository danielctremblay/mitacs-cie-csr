Their hard work has allowed us to continue providing our customers with the essential tissue and packaging products they need. The past few months have been unprecedented on many levels and we are incredibly proud of our employees' ongoing commitment to support each other, our customers, and our communities. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees. In early March we restricted work-related travel, implemented workplace social distancing measures, and introduced extensive cleaning protocols at our operations. We have also been in regular communication with our employees, providing them with protocols, updates and support when and where needed. At the operations level, we are maintaining open lines of communication with our customers to ensure that all product needs are being fulfilled and any supply gaps are identified and rectified quickly.Our first quarter results are a testament to the dedication and hard work of every one of our employees during these challenging times. Within this difficult context, first quarter sales increased 7% from the prior quarter. This reflected improvements in all business segments, most notably in Tissue, European Boxboard and specific Specialty Packaging products as a result of consumer buying patterns related to Covid-19 and strategic actions taken in recent quarters. Sales growth of 7% year-over-year was largely driven by increases in Tissue, which benefited from higher volumes and favourable average selling price, sales mix and exchange rate. Containerboard sales also increased year-over-year, as higher volumes and a beneficial exchange rate offset the impacts from a less favourable sales mix and lower average selling price. Sales in European Boxboard decreased slightly year-over-year largely due to lower average selling prices, while lower sales in Specialty Products reflect a business divestiture and mill closure in 2019.   First quarter adjusted OIBD of $161 million, which is net of a $10 million expected credit loss provision taken against accounts receivable amounts across our business segments, increased 6% sequentially and 19% compared to the prior year period. The sequential performance was driven by improved results in Tissue that reflected volume growth combined with a higher average selling price. Stronger sequential performances from the European Boxboard and Specialty Packaging segments also benefited from volume growth. European Boxboard results also reflected lower raw material pricing and lower average selling prices, while the reverse was true for Specialty Packaging. The year-over-year growth was entirely attributable to the improved performance in the Tissue segment.MARIO PLOURDEPresident and Chief Executive OfficerMay 6, 2020 1  Please refer to the ﬁSupplemental Information on Non-IFRS Measuresﬂ section for reconciliation of these figures.5                            5OUR BUSINESSCascades Inc. is a paper and packaging company that produces, converts and sells packaging and tissue products composed primarily of recycled fibres.

We believe it is useful for readers to be aware of these items as they provide additional information to measure performance, compare the Corporation™s results between periods, and assess operating results and liquidity, notwithstanding these specific items. Management believes these specific items are not necessarily reflective of the Corporation™s underlying business operations in measuring and comparing its performance and analyzing future trends. Our definition of specific items may differ from those of other corporations, and some of them may arise in the future and may reduce the Corporation™s available cash.  They include, but are not limited to, charges for (reversals of) impairment of assets, restructuring gains or costs, loss on refinancing and repurchase of long-term debt, some deferred tax asset provisions or reversals, premiums paid on long-term debt refinancing, gains or losses on the acquisition or sale of a business unit, gains or losses on the share of results of associates and joint ventures, unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps, foreign exchange gains or losses on long-term debt and financial instruments, specific items of discontinued operations and other significant items of an unusual, non-cash or non-recurring nature.  SPECIFIC ITEMS INCLUDED IN OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND NET EARNINGS The Corporation incurred the following specific items during the first quarters of 2020 and 2019: LOSS (GAIN) ON ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND OTHERS2020The Specialty Products segment recorded a $1 million environmental provision related to a plant in Québec that was closed in prior year.2019In the first quarter, the lease on the Bear Island facility in Virginia was terminated by the lessee. As such, the Containerboard segment recorded a gain of $10 million following the reversal of liabilities related to lease incentives to the lessee and to accrued carrying costs.IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS2019As a result of the lease termination on the Bear Island facility, described above, the Containerboard segment recorded a $3 million impairment charge on some assets that will not be used in the future.In the first quarter, the Specialty Products segment recorded $1 million of restructuring costs stemming from the closure of its Trois-Rivières, Québec, plant that manufactured felt backing for flooring. In the first quarter, the Tissue Papers segment recorded a $1 million impairment charge on some equipment, in addition to $4 million of restructuring costs related to the closure of two tissue paper machines in Ontario and changes in the segment's senior management.DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation recorded an unrealized gain of $1 million, compared to an unrealized gain of $3 million in the same period of 2019, on certain derivative financial instruments not designated for hedge accounting.FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSS (GAIN) ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation recorded a loss of $17 million on its US$-denominated debt and related financial instruments, compared to a gain of $6 million in the same period of 2019. This included a loss of $11 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to a gain of $4 million in the same period of 2019, on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated for hedge accounting. This also included a loss of $6 million during the period, compared to a gain of $2 million in the same period of 2019, on our US$-denominated long-term debt, net of our net investment hedges in the U.S. and Europe as well as forward exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments.8                            8RECONCILIATION OF NON-IFRS MEASURES To provide more information for evaluating the Corporation™s performance, the financial information included in this analysis contains certain data that are not performance measures under IFRS (ﬁnon-IFRS measuresﬂ), which are also calculated on an adjusted basis to exclude specific items. We believe that providing certain key performance measures and non-IFRS measures is useful to both Management and investors, as they provide additional information to measure the performance and financial position of the Corporation. This also increases the transparency and clarity of the financial information. The following non-IFRS measures are used in our financial disclosures: Ł Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD): Used to assess operating performance and the contribution of each segment when excluding depreciation and amortization. OIBD is widely used by investors as a measure of a corporation™s ability to incur and service debt and as an evaluation metric. Ł Adjusted OIBD: Used to assess operating performance and the contribution of each segment on a comparable basis. Ł Adjusted operating income: Used to assess operating performance of each segment on a comparable basis. Ł Adjusted net earnings: Used to assess the Corporation™s consolidated financial performance on a comparable basis. Ł Adjusted free cash flow: Used to assess the Corporation™s capacity to generate cash flows to meet financial obligations and/or discretionary items such as share repurchase, dividend increase and strategic investments. Ł Net debt to adjusted OIBD ratio: Used to measure the Corporation™s credit performance and evaluate financial leverage.Ł Net debt to adjusted OIBD ratio on a pro-forma basis: Used to measure the Corporation™s credit performance and evaluate the financial leverage on a comparable basis, including significant business acquisitions and excluding significant business disposals, if any. Non-IFRS measures are mainly derived from the consolidated financial statements, but do not have meanings prescribed by IFRS. These measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered on their own or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. In addition, our definitions of non-IFRS measures may differ from those of other corporations. Any such modification or reformulation may be significant.

As a result, the Corporation modified its segmented information disclosure and restated prior periods. The Corporation's recovery and recycling activities, previously included in the Specialty Products segment, are now included in the Corporate Activities since they support our North American packaging and Tissue Papers segments and are analyzed separately. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW - 2019On a consolidated basis, 2019 performance reflected solid sales levels, business acquisitions completed at the end of 2018 and in 2019, lower average raw material costs, stronger Tissue Papers results, favourable foreign exchange rates for our North American operations, and strategic initiatives and investments across our platforms. Annual consolidated sales totaled $4,996 million, an increase of $347 million or 7% compared to 2018 levels. This performance reflected business acquisitions and beneficial foreign exchange rates for the North American operations as noted above, in addition to more favourable average selling price and sales mix in the Tissue and Specialty Products business segments. These were partly offset by lower volumes in all business segments, with the exception of Specialty Products, and less advantageous sales pricing and mix in the Containerboard and European Boxboard segments, the latter of which also saw results impacted by unfavourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year.Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) increased by $78 million1, or 17%, to $550 million in 2019. This largely reflects strong year-over-year improved results in the Tissue Papers segment that were driven by more favourable average selling price and sales mix, lower raw material and energy costs, and the acquisition of Orchids activities in September 2019. Results in the Containerboard Packaging segment benefited from lower raw material prices, beneficial exchange rates, and slightly lower energy costs, the benefits of which were partially mitigated by slightly lower volumes, and higher production costs largely related to sales mix. European Boxboard performance was supported by lower raw material and energy pricing and recent business acquisitions. Less favourable average selling price, sales mix and foreign exchange rate had a negative impact on annual results compared to the prior year.  Results in the Specialty Products segment were above prior-year levels largely due to lower raw material pricing, benefits from 2018 acquisition, and more favourable selling price and sales mix. Slightly higher production costs partially offset these benefits. Recovery and recycling activities results of the Corporate activities segment were negatively impacted by falling prices of recycled brown paper.FINANCIAL OVERVIEW - FIRST QUARTER OF 2020Results for the first quarter reflect strong sales driven mostly by increased demand, amid the Covid-19 situation and the Orchids acquisition realized in the second half of 2019 in the Tissue Papers segment. The Tissue papers segment also benefited from higher average selling prices while the other three segments had a lower average selling price compared to last year's first quarter. However, the lower costs of brown and white recycled fibre grades benefited our four business segments. Given the uncertainty regarding the potential impact from the Covid-19 pandemic over the coming months, we continue to regularly update our financial and cash flow forecasts. Although, the pandemic had an overall favorable impact on volume levels in the first quarter, the Corporation recorded a $10 million expected credit loss provision on accounts receivable due to the higher level of uncertainty and credit risk.For the 3-month period ended March 31, 2020, sales increased by $83 million, or 7%, to reach $1,313 million, compared to $1,230 million in the same period of 2019. The Corporation recorded an operating income before depreciation and amortization of $161 million during the period, compared to $139 million in the same period of 2019. On an adjusted basis1, operating income before depreciation and amortization stood at $161 million, compared to $135 million last year.The Corporation posted net earnings of $22 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to net earnings of $24 million, or $0.26 per share, in the same period of 2019. On an adjusted basis2, the Corporation generated net earnings of $39 million in the first quarter of 2020, or $0.42 per share, compared to net earnings of $13 million, or $0.14 per share, in the same period of 2019. 1  2019 results have been adjusted to reflect retrospective adjustments of purchase price allocation.

The following transactions should be taken into consideration when reviewing the overall and segmented analysis of the Corporation™s 2020 and 2019 results.BUSINESS START-UP, ACQUISITION, DISPOSAL AND CLOSURESPECIALTY PRODUCTSŁ On September 30, 2019, the Corporation concluded the sale of its two facilities in France that convert cardboard into packaging for the paper industry. Ł In July 2019, the Corporation closed its plant that manufactured felt backing for flooring, located in Trois-Rivières, Québec.TISSUE PAPERSŁ On September 13, 2019, the Corporation announced the completion of the acquisition of Orchids assets. The assets include the Barnwell, South Carolina and Pryor, Oklahoma plants.Ł In the second quarter of 2019, the Corporation closed its tissue paper machines located in Whitby and Scarborough, Ontario. 15                            15SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND DEVELOPMENTS 2020The Corporation exercised its option to purchase the 20.2% interest in Greenpac Holding LLC ("Greenpac") held by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) on November 30, 2019 for an exercise price of US$93 million ($121 million). The transaction closed January 3, 2020 and increased the Corporation's, direct and indirect, ownership interest in Greenpac to 86.3%. 2019On November 26, 2019, the Corporation announced that it had completed its private offering of US$350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2026, US$300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2028 and $175 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2025. The net proceeds from the notes offering were used by the Corporation to redeem all of its outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2021 and US$400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2022 and repay certain amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The Corporation also paid $11 million of premiums and wrote off $3 million of unamortized financing costs related to these notes. On October 30, 2019, the Corporation announced the closure of its Waterford, New York and Kingman, Arizona tissue converting facilities, which produce a combined total volume of 9 million cases of tissue products. This volume will be transferred to the Corporation's other Tissue Papers facilities with available capacity and the newly acquired Orchids activities (see Note 5 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more details). The closure of these facilities is expected to gradually take place during the second quarter.On August 9, 2019, the Corporation announced an increase of its quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.08 per share. On May 31, 2019, the Corporation entered into an agreement with its lenders to extend and amend its existing $750 million revolving credit facility. The amendment extends the term of the facility to July 2023. The financial conditions remain unchanged.16                            16FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE 3-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 2019SALESSales of $1,313 million grew by $83 million, or 7%, compared with the same period last year. This reflected increases in all segments with the exception of Specialty Products, but was largely driven by the Tissue segment, where sales grew $98 million, or 28%, compared to the prior year. Specifically, sales in the Tissue segment reflected increased consumer demand in light of Covid-19, higher average selling price, more favourable sales mix and foreign exchange impact, and the addition of Orchids assets in the second half of 2019. European Boxboard sales decreased by $7 million, or 3%, compared with the previous year. This was largely driven by lower average selling prices in both recycled and virgin boxboard and a less favourable Canadian dollar - euro exchange rate, the effects of which were partially offset by higher volumes. Sales in the Specialty Products segment decreased 12% or $16 million year-over-year, reflecting the divestiture of the European activities and closure of the felt vinyl backing mill during the second half of 2019, the impacts of which outweighed the benefits from higher volume in Consumer packaging and favourable exchange rate. Lastly, sales in the Containerboard Packaging group increased by 4% or $17 million year-over-year, due primarily to higher volume and, to a lesser extent, by a more favourable exchange rate. These benefits were partially offset by a lower average selling price and less favourable sales mix year-over-year.  OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (OIBD)The Corporation generated an operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) of $161 million in the first quarter of 2020, which is net of a $10 million expected credit loss provision taken on accounts receivable amounts across the Corporation's business segments in relation to the current uncertainty caused by the pandemic. This compares with the $139 million generated in the same period last year, an increase of $22 million. The annual improvement was driven by the Tissue segment, where results benefited from lower raw material prices, volume gains, and more favourable average selling price and sales mix. European Boxboard results also improved slightly year-over-year, as benefits from lower raw material costs and higher volumes offset the impacts from lower average selling prices and higher production costs. The decrease in Containerboard results reflect a lower average selling price, higher operational and freight costs and less favourable sales mix, the effects of which mitigated the benefit from lower raw material costs. Specialty Products performance reflect higher operating and maintenance costs, partially offset by volume gains and improved realized spreads in some sub-sectors.  Adjusted OIBD1 was $161 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $135 million in the same period of 2019. 17                            17The main variances in sales and operating income before depreciation and amortization in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019, are shown below:Adjusted OIBD Please refer to the ﬁSupplemental Information on Non-IFRS Measuresﬂ section for reconciliation of these figures. Raw materials (OIBD)The impacts of these estimated costs are based on production costs per unit shipped externally or inter-segment, which are affected by yield, product mix changes, inbound freight costs and purchase and transfer prices. In addition to market pulp and recycled fibre, these costs include purchases of external boards and parent rolls for the converting sector, and other raw materials such as plastic and wood chips.F/X CAN$ (OIBD)The estimated impact of the exchange rate is based on the Corporation™s Canadian export sales less purchases, denominated in US$, that are impacted by exchange rate fluctuations and by the translation of our non-Canadian subsidiaries OIBD into CAN$. It also includes the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Corporation™s Canadian units in currency other than the CAN$ working capital items and cash positions, as well as our hedging transactions. It excludes indirect sensitivity (please refer to the ﬁSensitivity Tableﬂ section for further details).Other production costs andmix (OIBD)These costs include the impact of variable and fixed costs based on production costs per unit shipped externally, which are affected by downtime, efficiency and product mix changes.Recovery and Recyclingactivities (Sales and OIBD)While this sub-segment is integrated within the other segments of the Corporation, any variation in the results of Recovery and Recycling activities are presented separately and on a global basis in the charts. The analysis of variances in segment operating income before depreciation and amortization appears within each business segment review (please refer to the ﬁBusiness Segment Reviewﬂ section for more details).1  Please refer to the ﬁSupplemental Information on Non-IFRS Measuresﬂ section for reconciliation of these figures. 18                            18BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW PACKAGING PRODUCTS - CONTAINERBOARDOur IndustryU.S. containerboard industry production and capacity utilization rate 1U.S. containerboard inventories at box plants and mills 2Total U.S. containerboard production amounted to 9.5 million short tons in the first quarter of 2020, a sequential decrease of 2% and an 8% increase year-over-over, respectively. The industry registered an average capacity utilization rate of 94% during the quarter.The average inventory level increased 8% sequentially and decreased by 5% year-over-year during the first quarter of 2020.

Including 3.3 billion square feet in the first quarter   of 2020, compared to 3.1 billion square feet in the first quarter of 2019.3   Including sales to other partners in Greenpac.Shipments increased by 32,000 s.t., or 9%, in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. This reflects a 21,000 s.t. increase in external shipments from our containerboard mills due to higher market demand and a 10% increase in the capacity utilization rate. This led to a lower mill integration rate of 57% in the first quarter of 2020, compared with 59% for the first quarter of 2019. Including sales to associates3, the integration rate was 69% in the first quarter of 2020, compared with 71% last year. On the converting side, shipments increased by 8% (in billion square feet (MMSF)). This outperformed the Canadian and US markets which both increased by 4%.The average selling price denominated in Canadian dollars decreased by 9% for parent rolls and by 1% for converted products. The 1% average depreciation of the Canadian dollar compared to the US dollar partly offset these negative impacts on average selling prices.Sales increased by $17 million, or 4%, compared to the same period of 2019. The higher volume added $41 million to sales, while the 1% average depreciation of the Canadian dollar added $3 million. These benefits were partly offset by the less favourable mix of products sold and lower average selling price, which together subtracted $27 million. Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) decreased by $9 million, or 8% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019. Excluding specific items1 in both years, the $5 million decrease in adjusted OIBD reflects a net negative impact of $27 million related to the average selling price and less favourable sales mix. Higher freight costs subtracted $2 million from OIBD. In addition, higher operational costs, including an expected credit loss provision due to increased credit risk from the current Covid-19 pandemic, and higher chemical, repair and maintenance, indirect labour and warehousing costs, reduced OIBD by another $15 million. These were partly offset by lower costs of brown recycled fibre grades, which benefited results by $16 million. Higher volume and lower energy costs added $19 million and $4 million to the results, respectively. The segment incurred some specific items1 in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 that affected OIBD. Adjusted OIBD1 was $99 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $104 million in the same period of 2019.20                            20PACKAGING PRODUCTS - BOXBOARD EUROPEOur IndustryEuropean industry order inflow of coated boxboard 1In Europe, order inflows of white-lined chipboard (WLC) totaled approximately 860,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2020, a 7% and 6% increase sequentially and year-over-year, respectively. In European countries where our Boxboard Europe segment is active, WLC prices decreased by 2% and 3% sequentially and year-over-year, respectively. The folding boxboard (FBB) industry recorded order inflows of approximately 637,000 tonnes during the first quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 8% sequentially and 11% year-over-year.

This reflects the higher market demand in Europe and our increased market share. Shipments of virgin boxboard increased by 3,000 s.t., or 6%, while converted products shipments remained stable.The average selling price decreased in both euros and Canadian dollars year-over-year. Compared with the prior-year period, the average selling price of recycled boxboard decreased by •17, or 3%, while the average selling price of virgin boxboard decreased by •27, or 4%. The 2% average year-over-year appreciation of the Canadian dollar compared to the euro also added to the decline in average selling price when converted in Canadian dollars.The $7 million year-over-year decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2020 reflects the lower average selling prices, as mentioned previously, for $16 million and the 2% average year-over-year appreciation of the Canadian dollar compared to the euro for $6 million. Higher volume  partly offset the decrease by $15 million. Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) increased by $2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. The lower raw material costs provided $17 million while the higher volume also contributed $4 million to the OIBD. On the other hand, lower selling prices subtracted $16 million and higher production costs also lowered OIBD by $5 million. Lower energy costs also increased OIBD but were partly offset by fewer energy certificates received in the period for a net favourable impact of $1 million. The segment incurred some specific items1 in the first quarter of 2020 that affected OIBD. Adjusted OIBD1 was $30 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $29 million in the same period of 2019.22                            22PACKAGING PRODUCTS - SPECIALTY PRODUCTSCHANGE IN SEGMENTED INFORMATIONIn 2019, the Corporation modified its internal reporting in accordance with CODM requirements and business analysis. As a result, the Corporation modified its segmented information disclosure and restated prior periods. The Corporation's recovery and recycling activities, previously included in the Specialty Products segment, are now included in the Corporate Activities since they support our North American packaging and Tissue Papers segments and are analyzed separately.

Sales decreased by $16 million, or 12%, compared with the first quarter of 2019. Sales levels were negatively impacted by the divestiture of the  European activities and the closure of the vinyl backing felt mill for                      $19 million. This was partly offset by increased volume in the Consumer Products, plastics and moulded pulp products areas, as well as a favourable exchange rate.Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) decreased by $2 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. Higher realized spreads and higher volumes contributed positively to the results. These benefits were offset by higher operating and maintenance costs.The segment incurred some specific items1 in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 that affected OIBD. Adjusted OIBD1 was $12 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $14 million in the same period of 2019.24                            24TISSUE PAPERSOur IndustryU.S. tissue paper industry production (parent rolls) and capacity utilization rate 1U.S. tissue paper industry converted product shipments 1During the first quarter of 2020, parent roll production amounted to 2.4 million tons, up 2% sequentially and 4% compared to the same period last year. The average capacity utilization rate for the quarter stood at 94%, up by 3% sequentially and 2% compared to the first quarter of 2019.Shipments in the Away-from-Home market increased 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020. Shipments in the Retail market rose by 13% compared to the previous quarter and 14% versus the same period of 2019, amid the Covid-19 increase of demand.1  Source: RISIOur Performance The main variances1 in sales and operating income before depreciation and amortization for the Tissue Papers segment in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019, are shown below:1 For definitions of certain sales and operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) variation categories, please refer to the "Financial results for the 3-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 section for more details.

External manufacturing shipments increased by 4,000 s.t., or 14%, year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020. This largely reflects the lower integration rate of 73% in the current period, down from 76% in the same period of 2019, that was mainly due to the closure of two paper machines in Toronto, Canada in the first half of 2019. External converting shipments increased by 16,000 s.t., or 15%, year-over-year, mainly driven by new volume with key strategic customers and increased demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The acquisition of Orchids in the third quarter of 2019 added 15,000 s.t. to shipment levels in the first quarter of 2020.The 3% increase in the average selling price was mainly due to the 1%average depreciation of the Canadian dollar compared to the US dollar, a higher proportion of converted products, and a more favourable  mix of converted products sold. The price increases announced at the beginning of 2019 in both the Away-From-Home and Consumer Products sectors also positively impacted the average selling price.The 28% increase in sales in the first quarter of 2020 was largely driven by higher volumes, which added $85 million, including the acquisition of Orchids and the beneficial impact of higher selling prices and a favourable mix of customers and products sold, which added an additional $8 million. The favorable exchange rate benefited sales by $5 million.The significant increase in operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) reflects a $13 million benefit from lower recycled paper costs, higher volumes, which contributed $12 million, and higher selling prices and a favourable mix of customers and products sold, which added an additional $8 million. Lower energy costs benefited results by $7 million. These were partially offset by higher outsourcing costs required to fulfill our increase in market share despite production efficiency improvements and lower transportation costs. In addition, production costs per ton were higher year-over-year as a result of the greater proportion of sales of converted products, adding $7 million of costs compared to last year. While more expensive to produce, these products are sold at a higher selling price and margin. Other factors and foreign exchange rate added $3 million to OIBD. The segment incurred some specific items1 in the first quarter of 2019 that affected OIBD. Adjusted OIBD1 was $45 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $9 million in the same period of 2019.26                            26CORPORATE ACTIVITIESCorporate Activities included some specific items1 in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 that affected OIBD. Adjusted OIBD1 was a loss of                 $25 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with a loss of $21 million in the same period of 2019. The decrease is mainly explained by the additional costs incurred to support our strategic initiative to optimize our profitability through improvements in production efficiency, supply chain, sales and operation planning and net revenue management.Sales of our recovery and recycling activities declined as the market price of recycled paper fibre decreased compared to the first quarter of 2019. Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) remained relatively stable.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSEStock-based compensation expense recognized in the Corporate Activities amounted to $2 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with nil in the same period of 2019. For more details on stock-based compensation, see Note 21 of the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.1  Please refer to the ﬁSupplemental Information on Non-IFRS Measuresﬂ section for reconciliation of these figures. OTHER ITEMS ANALYSISDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATIONThe depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4 million to $71 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $67 million in the same period of 2019. The increase is mainly attributable to the Orchids acquisition in the second half of 2019 and capital expenditure investments completed during the last twelve months. Impairment charges recorded in 2019 partly offset this increase.FINANCING EXPENSE AND INTEREST ON EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS AND OTHER LIABILITIESThe financing expense and interest on employee future benefits and other liabilities amounted to $28 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $39 million in the same period of 2019, a decrease of $11 million. The variance is mainly attributable to the 2019 first quarter fair value revaluation recognized on the CDPQ put option, which amounted to $12 million due to Greenpac's improving financial performance. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESIn the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation recorded an income tax provision of $15 million, which compares to an income tax provision of $8 million in the same period of 2019. Greenpac is a limited liability company (LLC) and partners agreed to account for it as a disregarded entity for tax purposes. Consequently, income taxes associated with Greenpac net earnings are proportionately recorded by each partner based on its respective share in the LLC and no income tax provision is included in Greenpac™s net earnings. As such, although Greenpac is fully consolidated in the Corporation™s results, only 92% of pre-tax book income is considered for tax provision purposes (71.8% prior to the acquisition of CDPQ 20.2% participation in Greenpac on January 3, 2020).The effective tax rate and income taxes are affected by the results of certain subsidiaries and joint ventures located in countries where the income tax rates are different from those in Canada, notably the United States, France and Italy. The normal effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 28%. The weighted-average applicable tax rate was 25.2% in the first quarter of 2020.SHARE OF RESULTS OF ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURESShare of results of associates and joint ventures amounted to $3 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $2 million for the same period of last year. Refer to Note 8 of the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on associates and joint ventures. 27                            27LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIESCash flows from operating activities generated $119 million of liquidity in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $52 million generated in the same period of 2019. Changes in non-cash working capital components used $34 million of liquidity in the first quarter of 2020, versus                                     $30 million used in the same period of 2019. Stronger sales mainly towards the end of the first quarter and prepaid expenses, as well as a volume rebate payment which mostly occurs in the first quarter led to working capital requirements. As at March 31, 2020, average LTM working capital as a percentage of LTM sales stood at 9.9%, compared to 10.1% as at December 31, 2019. Cash flow from operating activities, excluding changes in non-cash working capital components, stood at $153 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $82 million in the same period of 2019. This cash flow measurement is relevant to the Corporation's ability to pursue its capital expenditure program and reduce its indebtedness.Following the redemption of our senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2019, an interest payment normally planned for January 2020 was done in December 2019 in the amount of $23 million. The Corporation also received $9 million of net income taxes in the first quarter of 2020, compared to nil for the same period in 2019.INVESTING ACTIVITIESInvesting activities used $75 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $66 million used in the same period of 2019.

The Corporation purchased 445,354 shares for cancellation at an average price of $11.53 for an amount of $5 million in the first quarter of 2020. The Corporation issued 471,557 shares at an average price of $5.83 as a result of the exercise of stock options in 2020, representing an aggregate amount of $3 million. Payment of other liabilities amounted to $121 million related to the purchase of CDPQ interest in Greenpac Holding LLC (see "Business Highlights" section for more details). Dividends paid to non-controlling interests amounted to $3 million in the first quarter of 2020. These payments are the results of dividends paid to the non-controlling shareholders of Greenpac and/or Reno de Medici.

Liquidity available via the Corporation™s credit facilities and the anticipated cash flow generated by its operating activities are expected to provide sufficient funds to meet our financial obligations and to fulfill our capital expenditure program for at least the next twelve months. As at March 31, 2020, the Corporation had $496 million (net of letters of credit in the amount of $18 million) available on its $750 million credit facility (excluding the credit facilities of our subsidiaries Greenpac and Reno de Medici). Cash and cash equivalents as at March 31, 2020are comprised as follows: $29 million in the parent company and restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the credit agreement) and $124 millionin unrestricted subsidiaries, mainly Greenpac and Reno de Medici. NEAR-TERM OUTLOOKAt this time we expect second quarter performance to be the result of a combination of tailwinds and headwinds in our different business segments. Specifically, Tissue results will reflect elevated raw material prices due to higher white recycled grade fibre costs and a greater use of virgin pulp due to lower levels of available recycled material. Containerboard margins are also expected to be impacted by higher OCC prices. Volumes in both Tissue and Containerboard are also forecasted to slow sequentially following an easing of the Covid-19 related pantry stocking trends seen in the first quarter and lower demand levels following business closures. Near-term Specialty Product performance is expected to reflect stronger consumer packaging trends, the effects of which should offset softness in industrial packaging. Boxboard Europe results are expected to increase slightly, supported by steady demand and announced industry price increases. Our priority is the health and safety of our employees, ensuring the continuity of our production to meet the needs of our customers, supporting community initiatives and working in partnership with customers impacted by the current business environment. We will remain vigilant in our cash flow management, and expect our projected available liquidity levels to meet future requirements. We will adjust investment plans further should they be required while continuing to manage our debt level. Given the uncertainty regarding the potential impact from the Covid-19 pandemic over the coming months, we are focused on prudent cash flow management, and have therefore reduced planned capital expenditures to a range of $175 to $200 million for the year, down from $250 million previously, but are maintaining our current dividend policy. Analysis of our Bear Island conversion project has continued at a slower pace given current circumstances, and as such we will not be providing any updated specifics or schedule at this time.30                            30CAPITAL STOCK INFORMATIONSHARE TRADINGCascades™ stock is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ﬁCASﬂ.

They have limited the scope of their design of DC&P and ICFR to exclude controls, policies and procedures of the Corporation™s 2019 business combinations. The design and evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the 2019 business combinations™ DC&P and ICFR will be completed within 365 days from the date of acquisition. The President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation, that the DC&P of the Corporation were effective as at March 31, 2020. Business combination™ balance sheet and results are included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. They constituted approximately 6.5% of total consolidated assets as of March 31, 2020, while they represented approximately 4.3% of consolidated sales and approximately a loss of 13.5% of consolidated net earnings attributable to Shareholders for the period ended March 31, 2020. Further details on these business combinations are disclosed in Note 4 of 2020 first quarter Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The ICFR was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial information presented is reliable and that the financial statements were prepared according to the IFRS. The President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the ICFR as at March 31, 2020 based on the control framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO Framework). Based on this evaluation, they have concluded that the Corporation™s ICFR were effective as of the same date. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, there were no changes in the Corporation™s ICFR that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Corporation™s ICFR.RISK FACTORSAs part of its ongoing business operations, the Corporation is exposed to certain market risks, including risks arising from changes in the selling prices of its principal products, the cost of raw material, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, all of which could have an impact on the Corporation™s financial position, operating results and cash flows. The Corporation manages its exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use these derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. Pages 56 to 65 of our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2019 contain a discussion of the key areas of the Corporation™s business risks and uncertainties and its mitigating strategies.

Earnings for each segment are prepared on the same basis as those of the Corporation. Intersegment operations are recorded on the same basis as sales to third parties, which are at fair market value. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Corporation's accounting policies described in its most recent Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.The Corporation's operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. The Chief Executive Officer has authority for resource allocation and management of the Corporation's performance and is therefore the CODM. The Corporation's operations are managed in four segments: Containerboard, Boxboard Europe and Specialty Products (which constitutes the Corporation™s Packaging Products) and Tissue Papers.SALESFor the 3-month periods ended March 31,(in millions of Canadian dollars) (unaudited)20202019Packaging ProductsContainerboard458441Boxboard Europe272279Specialty Products113129Intersegment sales(3)(4)840845Tissue Papers446348Intersegment sales and Corporate Activities27371,3131,230OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION ANDAMORTIZATIONFor the 3-month periods ended March 31,(in millions of Canadian dollars) (unaudited)20202019Packaging ProductsContainerboard102111Boxboard Europe3129Specialty Products1113144153Tissue Papers454Corporate Activities(28)(18)Operating income before depreciation and amortization161139Depreciation and amortization(71)(67)Financing expense and interest expense on employee future benefits and other liabilities(28)(39)Foreign exchange gain (loss) on long-term debt and financial instruments(17)6Share of results of associates and joint ventures32Earnings before income taxes484138                            38PAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENTFor the 3-month periods ended March 31,(in millions of Canadian dollars) (unaudited)20202019Packaging ProductsContainerboard1622Boxboard Europe511Specialty Products532636Tissue Papers2429Corporate Activities611Total acquisitions5676Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment(1)(1)Right-of-use assets and included in other debts(9)(15)4660Acquisitions for property, plant and equipment included in ﬁTrade and other payablesﬂBeginning of period4637End of period(19)(32)Payments for property, plant and equipment net of proceeds from disposals736539                            39NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)(tabular amounts in millions of Canadian dollars)NOTE 1 GENERAL INFORMATIONCascades Inc. and its subsidiaries (together ﬁCascadesﬂ or the ﬁCorporationﬂ) produce, convert and market packaging and tissue products composed mainly of recycled fibres. Cascades Inc. is incorporated and domiciled in Québec, Canada. The address of its registered office is 404 Marie-Victorin Boulevard, Kingsey Falls. Its common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.The Board of Directors approved the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements on May 6, 2020.NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES These Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS) applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which have been prepared in accordance with Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as set forth in Part I of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) Handbook Œ Accounting, which incorporates IFRS as issued by the IASB.The accounting policies applied in these Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are the same as those applied in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. Also, income taxes in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected annual earnings or loss for each jurisdiction.NOTE 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSThe preparation of Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. As an initial response to the effects of the crisis Covid-19 the Corporation reviewed the assumptions for operating plans, valuation of long-lived assets and accounts receivable. The exercise resulted in an increase by $10 million in the estimated credit loss for accounts receivable. The Corporation will continue to closely monitor the Covid-19 situation: the duration, spread or intensity of the pandemic as they further develop in 2020, the supply chain, market pricing and customer demand. These factors may further impact the Corporation™s operating plan, its cash flows, ability to raise funds and the valuation of its long-lived assets. Further information on critical accounting estimates and judgments is detailed in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2019.NOTE 4 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 2019 Orchids Paper Products On September 13, 2019, the Corporation acquired the assets of Orchids Paper Products Company (ﬁOrchidsﬂ) for a total consideration of $307 million, which consisted of US$235 million ($311 million) in cash, less $2 million for a purchase price adjustment and the settlement of a net liability of $2 million with the acquiree prior to the transaction. The Corporation recorded a bargain purchase gain on acquisition of the distressed assets of $25 million before transaction fees of $9 million. The assets include the Barnwell, South Carolina and Pryor, Oklahoma Tissue plants. As part of the transaction, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding units of OPP Acquisition Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V., designated as assets held-for-sale at acquisition date, which were resold the same day for US$14 million ($19 million).  This acquisition will accelerate the modernization of the Corporation's U.S. consumer product tissue platform by strengthening our operations and improving our geographic positioning.40                            40The $14 million fair value of accounts receivables is equal to gross contractual cash flows, which were all expected to be collected at the time of the acquisition.The purchase price allocation was finalized during the first quarter of 2020 and the adjustments were retroactively recorded at the date of acquisition.Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:2019BUSINESS SEGMENT:Tissue PapersACQUIRED COMPANIES:Orchids(in millions of Canadian dollars)Adjusted preliminaryallocationAdjustmentsFinal allocationFair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:Accounts receivable14115Inventories24Š24Assets held-for-sale19Š19Property, plant and equipment2903293Other assets1Š1Total assets3484352Trade and other payables(12)Š(12)Deferred income tax liabilities(7)(1)(8)Net assets acquired3293332Bargain purchase gain on acquisition(22)(3)(25)307Š307Net cash paid311Š311Purchase price adjustment(2)Š(2)Settlement of liability with acquiree before the transaction(2)Š(2)Total consideration307Š307NOTE 5 RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS The consolidated balance sheets include, in ﬁProperty, plant and equipmentﬂ, $175 million as at March 31, 2020 ($171 million as at   December 31, 2019) hereunder as right-of-use assets relating to leases.

(i) The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, bank loans and advances, trade and other payables and provisions approximates their carrying amounts due to their relatively short maturities.(ii) The fair value of investment in shares is based on observable market data and is quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange and classified as level 1.(iii) The fair value of long-term debt and some other liabilities is based on observable market data and on the calculation of discounted cash flows. Discount rates were determined based on local government bond yields adjusted for the risks specific to each of the borrowings and for the credit market liquidity conditions and are classified as levels 1 and 3.HIERARCHY OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUEThe following table presents information about the Corporation™s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the Corporation™s valuation techniques to determine such fair value. Three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilitiesLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect Management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liabilityFor commodity derivative financial instruments and foreign currency forward contracts, the Corporation classifies the fair value measurement as Level 2, as they are based mainly on observable market data. The fair value of commodity derivative financial instruments is determined using expected future cash flows based on observable data and notional quantity, with the resulting value discounted using a curve that reflects the credit risk of the Corporation or the counterparty, as applicable. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the measurement date, with the resulting value discounted back to present values using a curve that reflects the credit risk of the Corporation or the counterparty, as applicable.As at March 31, 2020(in millions of Canadian dollars)CARRYING AMOUNTQUOTED PRICES INACTIVE MARKETSFOR IDENTICALASSETS (LEVEL 1)SIGNIFICANTOBSERVABLE INPUTS(LEVEL 2)SIGNIFICANTUNOBSERVABLEINPUTS (LEVEL 3)Financial assetsEquity investments11ŠŠDerivative financial assets42Š42Š43142ŠFinancial liabilitiesDerivative financial liabilities(35)Š(35)Š(35)Š(35)ŠAs at December 31, 2019(in millions of Canadian dollars)CARRYING AMOUNTQUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS (LEVEL 1)SIGNIFICANT OBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 2)SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3)Financial assetsDerivative financial assets26Š26Š26Š26ŠFinancial liabilitiesDerivative financial liabilities(13)Š(13)Š(13)Š(13)Š42                            42NOTE 8 CAPITAL STOCKREDEMPTION OF COMMON SHARESIn 2019, in the normal course of business, the Corporation renewed its redemption program of a maximum of 1,878,456 common shares with the Toronto Stock Exchange, said shares representing approximately 2% of issued and outstanding common shares.
