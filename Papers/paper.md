# Vision statement

The adoption of CSR is increasing worldwide. Canadian companies are no different. As such, it may be useful to understand the state of the 
matter at this point in time to layout the portrait for all canadian public companies and for future references in a longitudinal perspective.

To analyse the 600+ canadian public companies, an approach using Text Mining of the company Websites has been devised. The premise is that a
company adopting CSR will report it on its corporate Website. In order to distinguish different company profiles, a classification has been 
applied to create clusters of similar profiles.
