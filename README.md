Data Supply Chain : Canadian Public Companies

# Description
This project is linked to the MITACS program. The objective is to automate key activities in competitive intelligence using OSINT. The vision includes :
- Listing Canadian Public Companies
- Gathering annual financial reports
- Processing reports
  - Extracting management team
  - Extracting board members
  - Extraction key financial figures
  - Extracting specific sections (ex. Corporate social responsibility)
- Leadership background analysis (education, positions)
- Leadership profile (ex. gender) and network analysis
- Official social media outlets monitoring
- Alternative information outlets monitoring.

Obviously this presentation is beyond a single project and translate to an ambitious program. It is however important to see the big picture to work efficiently on any of the part. The MITACS project will target the first phases and perhaps key interesting problems using an Agile process.

## Project Title
Systematic Analysis of the Business Environment : Big Data, Text Mining and Artificial intelligence
## Project Description
Countless businesses around the world still manage competitive and economic environment data manually today. With the advent of Big Data, this labour intensive approach has become anachronistic and futile. For this reason, the project, built as a proof of concept (PoC), aims specifically at creating a data pipeline to support timely business analysis and decision based on artificial intelligence and text mining. Specifically, the work involves collecting, analyzing and reporting on official business communications and economic data through diverse channels in an integrated and coherent way. This includes automating the collection of social media posts, press releases and financial reports by businesses for competitive intelligence and academic research. The reporting of key information in the appropriate manner that may include data visualization, dashboarding, infographics or standard document reporting. The project will rely on the Python language and its many data analysis libraries. Through an agile projet approach, data and documents will be collected, stored, mined and analyzed iteratively, one source at a time, to extract key features, meaning and relationships. The PoC will first focus on Canadian businesses as standardized access to financial documents is secured and will ensure the success of the project. The project is ideal for junior data scientists as it is structured as to yield quick value at each phase and to build the candidate skills portfolio in a stepwise manner. The project results will be presented by the candidate to students and staff at Universit√© de Sherbrooke's Business School. Convincing results will be communicated to the scientific community in conferences or articles.
## Project Goal
Implement a basic data science workflow based on analytics, text mining and AI to support the activity of analysis of corporate documents.  
## Project Timeline
- Week 1-3 : Literature review, process modelling, data acquisition development
- Week 4-6 : data preparation,  data analysis, insight rendering development : iteration 1 (basic workflow)
- Week 7-8 : data preparation,  data analysis, insight rendering development : iteration 2 (broadening of analyses)
- Week 9-10 : data preparation,  data analysis, insight rendering development : iteration 3 (increase in data)
- Week 11-12 : project finalisation and presentation
## Project Deliverables
- Basic data collection tool
- Text mining and network analysis workflow
- Insight visualization interface
- List of key papers on the subject
- Project slidedeck 
- Project report

## Project Interactions
The candidate and the researcher will meet on a weekly basis. Other researchers at UdeS may join the conversation on specific topics. The candidate will be asked to present its work to student and staff at UdeS at the end of the internship. I also have a second MITACS project. Candidates will be encouraged to share experiences, tips and insights throughout the project to sustain personal motivation.
