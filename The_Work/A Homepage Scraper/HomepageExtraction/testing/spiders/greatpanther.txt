Sustainability
Operating in a sustainable manner is embedded in our mission: to safely, sustainably and profitably produce gold and silver, for the benefit of our investors, employees, and communities. Our Sustainability Policy articulates our specific commitments in three key areas, which we believe provide the foundation for a sustainable mining business: safety and health, environmental responsibility, and community engagement and development. We have worked hard to develop and implement programs, initiatives, and results in each of these areas.
