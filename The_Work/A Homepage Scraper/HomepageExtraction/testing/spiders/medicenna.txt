Platform

                    At the core of Medicenna’s therapies are engineered interleukins designed to improve upon the specificity, function, and safety profile of unmodified interleukins. These powerful and proprietary therapies are known as Superkines, and can modulate, fine-tune or amplify the immune system to fight cancer, autoimmune or neuroinflammatory diseases. Our approach allows us the flexibility to transform Superkines into multi-functional therapies that can be delivered directly to where they are needed the most. Medicenna’s initial focus is on developing interleukin-2 (IL-2),  IL-4 and IL-13 super-agonists and antagonists.
