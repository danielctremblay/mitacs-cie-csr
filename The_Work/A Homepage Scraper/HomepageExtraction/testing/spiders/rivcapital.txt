Investors Where the smart money goes. 


RIV Capital is embarking on a phase of our company’s development that we believe will create significant value for shareholders. We believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the growing U.S. cannabis market. RIV Capital’s structure, liquidity position, and industry expertise make it an attractive partner for U.S. operators seeking a public company partner with a strong balance sheet, while our portfolio provides investors with unique exposure to specialized cannabis companies across the value chain.
