Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Dia Bras Peru S.A.C., Sierra Metals acquired 82% of Minera Corona, S.A. ("Corona") in May of 2011. Established in 1993, Corona is a Peruvian company engaged in the exploration, extraction, production and commercialization of copper, lead and zinc concentrates, with high silver and gold components at the Yauricocha Mine in Yauyos Province, Peru. In addition to the producing mine, the Yauricocha property is host to multiple near-mine and regional exploration targets. Sierra Metals´ current land position in Peru exceeds 50,000 hectares.

Sierra Metals Properties
Bacerac Property
On the Bacerac property, Sierra is targeting an area of historic workings known as the San Patricio prospect, where initial confirmation sampling over an interval of 8.3 m yielded weighted averages of 2.3 g/t Au and 1,722 g/t Ag, along with significant values of copper and lead. The Company’s geologists have mapped, trenched and sampled the San Patricio area, with reported results including a 23.5 m trench length averaging 0.59 g/t Au and 200.2 g/t Ag. Mineralization is hosted by shallow-dipping breccias.
Core drilling by Sierra resulted in a low recovery of samples from the breccias zones and further drilling is planned with RC (reverse circulation) method in order to improve sample recovery from the target breccias.

Moris Property
The Moris Property is a low-sulphidation epithermal gold and silver prospect that incorporates several historic mines and is being evaluated for potential near-term small-scale production.

Arechuyvo
The Arechuyvo project lies in a region with large exposures of Mesozoic limestone and shale that have been intruded by a large granodiorite pluton near Arechuyvo and numerous mineral occurrences are present. The area is prospective for epithermal precious metal mineralization and for copper skarns and polymetallic replacement mineralization.

Maguarichic Property
The Maguarichic property is host to epithermal hot spring gold prospects. In November 2010, Fresnillo, Plc. (“Fresnillo”), and the Company reached an amicable agreement whereby Fresnillo gave up its 30% interest in all of Maguarichic, and the Company transferred approximately 30% of the land concessions it held in the western section of the concessions to Fresnillo. The Company now holds 100% direct interest in its remaining Maguarichic Property.

Oribo
The Oribo project is in the San Rafael de Oribo area of western Chihuahua State, Mexico. These concessions are located about 23 km west of Monterde and 25 km north of the Palmarejo and Guazapares districts.
The primary exploration target on the property consists of strongly silicified and brecciated limestone and marble with local skarn occurrences near the contact with intrusions of intermediate composition. Manhattan Minerals (Manhattan) previously explored a portion of the property in 1996 and 1997.

Batopilas Property
The Company began reconnaissance exploration work on the Batopilas property in 2011 with encouraging results. The presence of visible free gold in stream sediments was identified over an 8 km2 area within the 25 km2 La Verde alteration area and is a high-priority target for detailed follow-up work for high- to medium-sulphidation gold mineralization. The property also hosts the Corralitos prospect, a molybdenum-copper deposit that was partially drilled by a previous owner in 1997 and drilled by the Company in 2011 with encouraging results. The primary target at Corralitos is stockwork-hosted molybdenum mineralization adjacent to a major NNE-trending fault.

East Durango
The East Durango project is located in the center of the Mexican Silver Belt, one of the most active exploration areas in Mexico due to major discoveries such as Penasquito and the nearby ECU property. The property was explored in the 1990s by Laminco and its joint venture partner, Carlin Gold. These companies identified large geochemical soil anomalies for gold, as well as the indicator elements arsenic, antimony and mercury, in an area with geologic characteristics similar to the sedimentary rock hosted gold deposits of Nevada.
