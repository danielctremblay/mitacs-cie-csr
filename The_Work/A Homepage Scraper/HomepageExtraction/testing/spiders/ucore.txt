AMERICAN CRITICAL-METALS INDEPENDENCE STARTS HERE

AMERICAN CRITICAL-METALS INDEPENDENCE STARTS HERE

THE FUTURE IS NOW.Ucore’s vision and plan is to deliver leading advanced technology that provides separation and mining services to the mining and mineral extraction industry.  As such, we are guided by the principles of being socially and environmentally responsible with good corporate governance (ESG).
Ucore’s path forward is a crucial one to ensure that China’s current dominance of over 80% of the world’s supply of rare earth elements (REEs) does not lead to the loss of thousands of “green” technology jobs as manufacturers are forced to set up overseas to access these critical metals. We must and we will play our part to keep the US and North America competitive in the 21st century and most important secure from foreign adversaries.
Through strategic partnerships, this vision includes disrupting China’s dominance of the US REE supply chain through the development of a HREE processing facility – the Alaska Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) in Southeast Alaska and the long-term development of its HREE resource located at Bokan Mountain on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska.

“Above all, we need to aggressively remind public and policy makers that there is no “E” in ESG without the mines to supply the raw materials for any energy transition.”
