The indicator is below prices when prices are rising and above prices when prices are falling. In this regard, the indicator stops and reverses when the price trend reverses and breaks above or below the indicator.The Prices Channels indicator calculates the x period moving averages of the securities high and low values and plots these against the security prices.The Weighted Close indicator is simply an average of each day's price.
