The Amon Carter Museum of American Art library's noncirculating collection is reflective of the 
museum's art collection; as such, it focuses on American art and photography 
from the early nineteenth century to the present. Broader focuses include 
the cultural, social, and intellectual history of the same period. The library 
is especially rich in materials related to the American West.Collection highlights include the finest examples of nineteenth- and 
twentieth-century 
illustrated books and western Americana, nineteenth-century newspapers on 
microfilm, and an extensive vertical file collection offering a range of 
material on artists, museums, commercial galleries, and subjects. The 
library's collection includes over 40,000 books and exhibition catalogs, 800 
periodical titles, and over 100,000 pieces of microform, including the Archives of American Art on microfilm.The library is open to the public during the following hours:Other times are by appointment. Please email  for assistance.© Copyright 2005, CDLC, Cultural District Library Consortium
