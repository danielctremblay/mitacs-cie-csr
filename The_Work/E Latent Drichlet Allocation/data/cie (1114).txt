INDUSTRY OVERVIEW






















Prevention & Treatment






In the United States, tobacco smoke is a key factor in the development and progression of COPD, although exposure to air pollutants in the home and workplace, genetic factors, and respiratory infections also play a role. Chronic lower respiratory disease, primarily COPD, was the third leading cause of death in the United States in 2014. Almost 15.7 million Americans (6.4%) reported that they have been diagnosed with COPD and more than 50% of adults with low pulmonary function were not aware that they had COPD, so the actual number may be higher. COPD can cause serious long-term disability and early death. There's no cure, but COPD can be prevented and treated.
