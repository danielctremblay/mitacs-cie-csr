He is a strong public champion of evidence-based solutions for the opioid crisis and a national pain and addictions strategy.


Abstract:Neuropathic pain is a major source of morbidity with an estimated 45 million people globally suffering from this condition. There are many causes of neuropathic pain and this condition has been treated with conventional analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents. First line therapeutic agents include anti-depressants and anti-convulsants and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)* . Yet many patients do not obtain relief from their pain. Opioids often become the mainstay of treating intractable neuropathic pain which can become problematic long-term. An overview of the use of cannabis in pain medicine and the its potential uses longterm will be discussed in this presentation.

Canada’s Leadership Position in the Emerging Global Industry

 



Aras Azadian, Avicanna Inc.


Aras brings extensive senior management experience in the biotechnology and financial sectors including his involvement in several successful start-up companies.

Aras holds a Bachelor of Economics degree from York University in Toronto, and an International Masters in Management degree from EADA Business School in Barcelona, Spain.


Abstract: As the first G8 country to federally legalize medicinal and now recreational cannabis, Canada has established itself as a forerunner in this sector and has therefore secured an early leadership position in the blossoming industry at a global level. This position can be attributed to early access to financing and capital markets, which has been fruitful for the early Canadian licensed producers as well as the investment community.


As the industry continues to evolve, Canadian firms hoping to sustain this leadership position need to acknowledge that with this opportunity comes a responsibility, specifically to scientific vigor, environmental sustainability and strict quality controls.


We are at a crossroads, where we have the potential to establish a legitimate and sustainable industry within Canada or we risk losing our position as global pioneers.

He is particularly interested in the design of innovative clinical trials, translational oncology, and genomic-based biomarker discovery, conveying his clinical and research expertise towards novel treatments for patients with cancer.


Abstract: The active components of Cannabis sativa and their derivatives (i.e. Cannabinoids) have increasingly recognized favorable effects for managing cancer- and treatment-related symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, pain, anorexia. In addition, these compounds have been shown to delay and/or inhibit the growth of tumor cells in pre-clinical studies. In the context of a rapidly changing scientific, clinical and legal landscape for exploiting Cannabinoids attributes, we discuss their role in oncology. Particularly, the pressing need for clinical research and drug development strategies that could expand the therapeutic armamentarium and ultimately improve outcomes for cancer patients.

Abstract: Cannabinoids have been used as natural medicines for centuries; however, their biological activity in the skin is a new area of study. Recent data suggests that cannabinoids are involved in neuro-immuno-endocrine modulation of skin functioning. Specifically, cannabinoids have an inhibitory effect on skin inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis, pain, and itch, biological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of many dermatologic conditions. These mechanisms make cannabinoids attractive for conditions such as dermatitis, acne, localized scleroderma and due to their wound healing properties for management of orphan conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa.

Abstract: Cannabinoids have been used for many years for treatment on a diversity of symptoms and medical conditions. Due to their psychotropic effect and its legal status most of the research is anecdotic. However many publications in several therapeutic areas and with different level of evidence and quality have been released for years in pre-clinical and clinical settings. We present a review of the research experience with cannabinoids and its potential for future research in different therapeutic areas and the need for well designed valid and powered studies in order to create strong evidence.

Dr. Gorecki joins dicentra with over 8 years of clinical medicine experience in various therapeutic areas and patient care settings. After completing her family medical internship in the United States, she pursued her passion of helping others by participating in a Medical Mission in the Caribbean, followed by Oncology Research at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in New Hampshire.Since 2015, Edith has been working with various Clinical Research Organizations in the Pharmaceutical and Nutraceutical industries. She has experience with organizing, managing and executing clinical trials (phases I-III) under ICH GCP guidelines in the US and Canada.


Abstract: With the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, isolated cannabinoids have been investigated to define therapeutic applications by conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials. With the federal government acknowledging the medical potential for cannabinoids, regulatory pathways have been developed for clinical trial development to ensure the safety and efficacy for the general public. Navigating through these pathways set forth by Health Canada may be daunting and covered with red tape, however with the proper guidance, applications for clinical trial approval will ensure Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards are followed and that the use of the cannabinoids being studied in patients are appropriate.

Toxicology and Pharmacology of Cannabinoids

 



Dr. Ruth Ross, PhD, University of Toronto


Ruth Ross is engaged in research into the molecular pharmacology of the cannabinoids and related lipid signalling systems. Her research is directed both toward gaining insight into the deleterious effects of cannabis smoking, the potential for cannabis a medicine and the development of small molecules targeting G protein coupled receptors. Together with medicinal chemists she is engaged in the development of novel small molecule therapeutics for major diseases including chronic pain, addiction, cancer and diabetes.


Abstract: The ‘endocannabinoids’ arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are synthesised on demand and are rapidly inactivated by enzymes. There is ample evidence that the levels of endocannabinoids are increased in both physiological and pathophysiological situations, in which an autoprotective action of the endocannabinoids has been also implicated. Mammalian tissues express at least two types of cannabinoid receptor, CB 1 and CB 2 , both G protein coupled receptors (GPCR). Endocannabinoids interact with cannabinoid receptors and levels are elevated in response to certain triggers. For example, they are increased in response to nerve injury – reducing pain and inflammation; they are increased in response to stress to elevate mood. As such, the endocannabinoid system is a promising target for management of certain conditions including, for example, pain and inflammation. The primary constituents of cannabis (THC and CBD) interact with the endocannabinoid system in various ways; leading to potential therapeutic effects, but which may be accompanied by side- effects. The goal of current research is to assess the safety and efficacy of THC and CBD in a range ofillnesses; identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of their action.

Abstract: Similar to more than 40% of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), cannabinoids have limited aqueous solubility, which creates challenges in formulation development and administration (e.g. oral, injectable, dermal routes). In order to improve the bioavailability and efficacy of these APIs for use in specific indications there is a need for well-designed drug formulations. The formulations must improve the solubility and stability of the API while resulting in sufficient bioavailability to yield the desired therapeutic effect and assure good safety and toxicity profiles. Attention must also be given to the scalability of the formulation to ensure translation from pre-clinical lab bench to industrial production. This seminar will provide an overview of the many considerations behind rational cannabinoid formulation design and strategies to ensure successful tech transfer to industrial scale development.

Abstract: This is an exciting time for the medical cannabis industry with new medical cannabis products in late stage pre-clinical and clinical development, clinical product approvals and industry deals totaling billions of dollars. However, the two most studied cannabinoids, cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol, are beginning to be considered a cure-all for near to every minor ailment and chronic condition. Is this cause for concern? Another emerging critical question is whether or not scientific data and medical evidence support the current level of interest and investment in this area. This presentation addresses these questions and draws attention to the importance of recognizing that “legal and natural” are not equivalent to “safe and effective”. An overview of the historical use of medical cannabis with an emphasis on the latest groundbreaking developments will be provided. Medical cannabis formulations that are currently on the market will be reviewed with critical analysis of available clinical efficacy and safety data. Moreover, recommendations for pre-clinical and clinical studies will be provided with a goal towards the development of products that are safe and effective, and result in meaningful improvements in patient outcomes.
