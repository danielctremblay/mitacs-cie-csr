WARNING:  There are reports of persons in Zimbabwe illicitly posing as employees of the group acting in a procurement capacity, in particular fraudsters pretending to act on behalf of Blanket Mine and contacting mining suppliers to obtain equipment by deception.  Anyone who is approached by a person purporting to act for Blanket Mine or Caledonia with a view to supplying goods or services should always check that the purported company representatives are genuine employees and if you have any doubts please contact us.  Neither Caledonia nor Blanket Mine can be held responsible for any failure by third parties to check the authenticity of order enquiries or persons holding themselves out as acting on our behalf and accordingly any loss they may suffer as a result.
