      PageSpeed Insights (PSI) reports on the performance of a page on both mobile and desktop
      devices, and provides suggestions on how that page may be improved.
    
      PSI provides both lab and field data about a page. Lab data is useful for debugging
      performance issues, as it is collected in a controlled environment. However, it may not
      capture real-world bottlenecks. Field data is useful for capturing true, real-world user
      experience - but has a more limited set of metrics. See  for more information on the 2 types of data.
    
      At the top of the report, PSI provides a score which summarizes the page’s performance.
      This score is determined by running  to collect and
      analyze  about the page. A score of 90 or above is considered good.
      50 to 90 is a score that needs improvement, and below 50 is considered poor.
    
      When PSI is given a URL, it will look it up in the  (CrUX) dataset. If available, PSI reports the  (FCP),  (FID),
       (LCP), and  (CLS) metric data for the origin and potentially the specific page URL.
    
      PSI also classifies field data into 3 buckets, describing experiences deemed good, needs
