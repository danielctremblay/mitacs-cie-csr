For those who have not read the first volume
of this series, “Witch Winnie, the Story
of a King’s Daughter.”(Let it here be explained that although my
name is Nellie, I am never called anything but
Tib by my friends.)We occupied a little suite of apartments in
the tower, consisting of a small study parlor
from which opened two double bedrooms and
one single one. Our family was called the
Amen Corner, because our initials, arranged
as an acrostic, spelled the word Amen, and
because we were a set of little Pharisees, prigs,
and “digs,” not particularly admired by the
rest of the school, but exceedingly virtuous
and preternaturally perfect in our own estimation.This was our status at the beginning of our
first school year together, and the change that
came over us, owing to the introduction into
our circle of Witch Winnie, the greatest scape-grace
in the most mischief-making set of the
school, the “Queen of the Hornets,” has already
been told. A quieting, earnest influence
acted upon Winnie, and a natural, merry-hearted
love of fun reacted on us, and we were
all the better
