Programs for skin and ocular diseaseTwo of InMed’s most advanced programs focus on rare cannabinoid formulations for skin and ocular diseases. Cannabinol (CBN), a rare cannabinoid, is the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in InMed’s two lead programs for epidermolysis bullosa and glaucoma. InMed’s INM-755 is a CBN topical cream under development for epidermolysis bullosa, a devastating, rare genetic skin disease. InMed has completed two Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers. InMed’s second program, INM-088, is a CBN-based product being developed as a topical ocular formulation for glaucoma and is currently in preclinical studies. Learn more about our programs in epidermolysis bullosa and glaucoma.    A goal to deliver safe and effective cannabinoid treatmentsInMed’s preclinical studies of cannabinol (CBN) demonstrated an excellent safety profile. In preclinical studies, CBN showed the potential for therapeutic benefit over other cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The findings from these extensive studies supported the advancement of INM-755 cream as an investigational treatment for epidermolysis bullosa (EB) into Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers. Two Phase 1 studies have been completed and plans are underway to file regulatory applications for a Phase 2 study in EB patients in several countries in the first half of 2021.    learn More  Integrated cannabinoid manufacturing system to produce pharmaceutical-grade, bio-identical cannabinoidsWhile rare cannabinoids may hold tremendous potential as new treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs, it is not economically feasible to extract and purify most of them directly from the plant due to the very low quantities available.IntegraSynTM, InMed’s integrated cannabinoid manufacturing system, uses multiple standard pharmaceutical processes to enable the production of cannabinoids with bio-identical structures as compared to those found in nature.   learn More     Click to enlarge Successful track recordInMed aims to transform patients’ lives by developing safe and effective cannabinoid-based therapeutics across a broad spectrum of diseases with high unmet medical needs.Since our formation in 2014, we have fortified our capital position, assembled a world class leadership team with a successful track record in drug development, strengthened our potentially game-changing technologies, and advanced our novel, cannabinoid-based pipeline of drug candidates.Today, InMed is acutely focused on building a technologically advanced cannabinoid pharmaceutical company unlike any other.   learn More  Latest News  InMed Pharmaceuticals Submits Clinical Trial Applications to Evaluate INM-755 (Cannabinol) Cream in a Phase 2 Trial for Epidermolysis Bullosa   April 28, 2021   Learn More   InMed Pharmaceuticals Announces Voluntary Delisting from TSX   April 27, 2021   Learn More   InMed Pharmaceuticals Achieves 2g/L Cannabinoid Yield with IntegraSyn™   April 26, 2021   Learn More   InMed to Present at Virtual Conferences in March 2021   March 3, 2021   Learn More   InMed Announces Closing of US$4.5 Million Private Placement   February 16, 2021   Learn More   InMed Pharmaceuticals Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results   February 11, 2021   Learn More InMed Pharmaceuticals Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial ResultsMay 13, 2021Learn MoreInMed Pharmaceuticals to Report Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial ResultsMay 06, 2021Learn MoreInMed to Present at Canaccord Genuity’s 5th Annual Global Cannabis Conference on May 11th, 2021May 04, 2021Learn MoreInMed Pharmaceuticals Submits Clinical Trial Applications to Evaluate INM-755 (Cannabinol) Cream in a Phase 2 Trial for Epidermolysis BullosaApr 28, 2021Learn MoreInMed Pharmaceuticals Announces Voluntary Delisting from TSXApr 27, 2021Learn MoreInMed Pharmaceuticals Achieves 2g/L Cannabinoid Yield with IntegraSyn™Apr 26, 2021Learn More   See all news    Investor Alerts Sign up to receive news releases from InMed Pharmaceuticals.
