And even though many of our members and customers still work in offices, our community is so much richer than that. We work in classrooms and on construction sites, in laboratories and on production lines, in retailers and in restaurants.     When we write and speak, we want you to feel like we’re your teammate at work, someone you like and trust. Someone who’s always on your side. Someone you can lean on for guidance, encouragement, and expertise. Someone who has a genuine interest in helping you be your best professional self.    Our photography shows the breadth of professionals and careers on our platform. We traveled around the world to document real people at work, and the range of real situations and emotions that they experience every day.    Our illustration, typography, and colors convey our brand’s warmth, humanity, and community. We’ve updated our logo. And we’re on a journey to make sure our design is accessible and inclusive to all our members and customers.  Our illustration shows people connecting in the interactions that take place every day.
