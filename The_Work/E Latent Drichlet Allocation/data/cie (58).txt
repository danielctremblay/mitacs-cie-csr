3D Mammography

                        Three-dimensional mammography (also called digital breast tomosynthesis) creates a three-dimensional picture of the breast using x-rays. Several low-dose images from different angles around the breast are used to create the 3D picture. A 3D mammogram takes a few seconds longer than a 2D mammogram because more images are taken, but if you’ve had a mammogram in the past you won’t likely notice a difference. We encourage you to visit our Health Library to learn even more about breast imaging.                        
 
Bone Density (DEXA)

                        A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA) is a test to determine your bone density and mineral content which is then compared with what is normally expected in a healthy young adult of your sex. The bones that are most commonly tested are in the spine, hip and sometimes the forearm. Your test result will help your healthcare provider make recommendations to help you protect your bones or treat the early signs of osteoporosis.                          
 
Calcium Scoring

                        Calcium scoring is the standard test to detect coronary artery calcification. CACS uses a Computed Tomography (CT) scan to find the buildup of calcium on the walls of the arteries of the heart. The test identifies your level of deposits and produces a calcium score. Normally, the coronary arteries do not contain calcium, therefore a finding of calcium in the coronary arteries is the earliest indicator of heart disease. Taking into account other factors such as age, family history and cholesterol level, your doctor uses this score to measure your potential for heart disease and to determine how severe it is. We encourage you to visit our Health Library to learn even more about Calcium Scoring.                        
 
Cardiac PET

                        Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) uses a radioactive tracer to evaluate heart tissue functioning. It is a very accurate way to diagnose coronary artery disease and detect areas of low blood flow in the heart. A cardiac PET scan can help in determining if you’ll benefit from a cardiac procedure or surgery to restore blood flow. The tracers used for the scans can help identify injured but still living (viable) heart muscle that might be saved if blood flow is restored in time.                        
 
Echocardiography

                        An echocardiogram is an ultrasound scan of the heart. The scan can give accurate pictures of the heart muscle, the heart chambers, and structures within the heart. Abnormalities such as damaged heart valves, thickened heart muscle, and some congenital heart defects, can be seen quite clearly. The echoes are detected by a probe that the operator moves around over the skin’s surface to obtain views from different angles. The images are displayed as a picture on a monitor and the images are constantly updated so the scan can show movement as well as structure. Please visit our Health Library to learn about the different types of echocardiography tests your physician may order for you.                        
 
MR Arthrogram

                        An arthrogram is a two-part procedure used to obtain detailed pictures of the inside of a joint; commonly the shoulder, knee, hip, or wrist. After a contrast medium is injected by a needle into the joint, the radiographer obtains a series of MRI scans to help properly diagnose the cause of pain or restricted motion of a joint.

3D Mammography

                        Three-dimensional mammography (also called digital breast tomosynthesis) creates a three-dimensional picture of the breast using x-rays. Several low-dose images from different angles around the breast are used to create the 3D picture. A 3D mammogram takes a few seconds longer than a 2D mammogram because more images are taken, but if you’ve had a mammogram in the past you won’t likely notice a difference. We encourage you to visit our Health Library to learn even more about breast imaging.                        
 
Bone Density (DEXA)

                        A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA) is a test to determine your bone density and mineral content which is then compared with what is normally expected in a healthy young adult of your sex. The bones that are most commonly tested are in the spine, hip and sometimes the forearm. Your test result will help your healthcare provider make recommendations to help you protect your bones or treat the early signs of osteoporosis.                          
 
Calcium Scoring

                        Calcium scoring is the standard test to detect coronary artery calcification. CACS uses a Computed Tomography (CT) scan to find the buildup of calcium on the walls of the arteries of the heart. The test identifies your level of deposits and produces a calcium score. Normally, the coronary arteries do not contain calcium, therefore a finding of calcium in the coronary arteries is the earliest indicator of heart disease. Taking into account other factors such as age, family history and cholesterol level, your doctor uses this score to measure your potential for heart disease and to determine how severe it is. We encourage you to visit our Health Library to learn even more about Calcium Scoring.                        
 
Cardiac PET

                        Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) uses a radioactive tracer to evaluate heart tissue functioning. It is a very accurate way to diagnose coronary artery disease and detect areas of low blood flow in the heart. A cardiac PET scan can help in determining if you’ll benefit from a cardiac procedure or surgery to restore blood flow. The tracers used for the scans can help identify injured but still living (viable) heart muscle that might be saved if blood flow is restored in time.                        
 
Echocardiography

                        An echocardiogram is an ultrasound scan of the heart. The scan can give accurate pictures of the heart muscle, the heart chambers, and structures within the heart. Abnormalities such as damaged heart valves, thickened heart muscle, and some congenital heart defects, can be seen quite clearly. The echoes are detected by a probe that the operator moves around over the skin’s surface to obtain views from different angles. The images are displayed as a picture on a monitor and the images are constantly updated so the scan can show movement as well as structure. Please visit our Health Library to learn about the different types of echocardiography tests your physician may order for you.                        
 
MR Arthrogram

                        An arthrogram is a two-part procedure used to obtain detailed pictures of the inside of a joint; commonly the shoulder, knee, hip, or wrist. After a contrast medium is injected by a needle into the joint, the radiographer obtains a series of MRI scans to help properly diagnose the cause of pain or restricted motion of a joint.

Scheduling



What are your operating hours?
Each center has its own operating hours that can be found on the center's listing page at akumin.com. The majority of our centers are open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday with a number of locations also offering extended early morning, evening, and weekend appointments.

Booking your imaging appointment is easy.  You can either call the center of your choice directly.  The number can be found on the center's location page on our website.  Alternatively, you can complete our online booking form and an Akumin representative will call you back to confirm the appointment time and details.


If the phones are busy, is there another way to schedule my appointment?
From time to time throughout the day we may experience a surge in call volume that often results in longer on-hold wait times.  If you are in a hurry, you can complete our online booking form and an Akumin representative will call you back to confirm the appointment time and details.


How soon can I book an appointment? Can I fit my appointment into my work schedule?
Our centers offer extended hours, including early mornings, evenings and weekends. In many cases, we can schedule you for the same day you call for an appointment. Our goal is to schedule your appointment at the best possible time for you.


What if I am unable to keep my appointment? 
If you are unable to keep your appointment, please call your local center and your physician will be notified and your examination rescheduled. If transportation is an issue, the center can help make arrangements for you.

What type of clothing should I wear for my exam?
Wear comfortable, metal-free clothing (i.e. sweatpants, T-shirt, shorts, metal-free bra, etc.) do not wear leggings if undergoing an MRI as they sometimes contain metal particles. It may be necessary for you to change into our patient gowns or scrubs depending on the area being scanned. 


Do you provide lockers for personal belongings?
Secure lockers will be provided for your clothing and purse. We advise patients to leave all jewelry and valuables at home.


Will I need a driver?
Some procedures require a driver for your safety (i.e. if sedation or anesthetic are administered). When the appointment is made, you will be told if a driver is needed. Due to the current COVID-19 restrictions, the person driving you to or from the center  cannot accompany you into the facility.





Appointments 



Can someone accompany me to my appointment?
Due to the current COVID-19 restrictions, patients cannot be accompanied within the center by another person unless the patient is a minor or has disabilities that require assistance. If someone is driving you to your appointment they will need to wait outside. Please call ahead to the center if you have questions about this policy.

To avoid delays or the postponement of your exam, please remember to bring your complete insurance information including all insurance cards, a valid photo ID, as well as your physician's referral.

Why is it a women's only center?
As women, our health can change constantly; from pregnancy, to menopause and age related bone loss. These changes usually require specific tests and a more detailed explanation of the findings and desired follow-ups.  Our women’s only centers allow us to focus on conducting these exams and providing information to the patient in a stress-free and relaxed environment.

How often should patients receive a screening mammography?
Most insurance companies will pay for a screening mammogram every 366 days.

If I'm worried about my risk of exposure to COVID-19, can I make changes to my appointment?
Subject to local public health orders intended to fight the novel coronavirus, some Akumin patients with scheduled screening studies may experience a deferral of their studies.  Patients are encouraged to contact their Akumin center to confirm their appointment.  We will respect and accommodate any patient’s request to defer their imaging procedures to a later date, particularly as it relates to any non-urgent imaging service. 


Have additional COVID-19 safety measures have been implemented?
Akumin continues to follow CDC and state and local health department guidelines relating to infectious disease protocols. We are pre-screening individuals entering our facilities and limiting the number of individuals in our centers and applying other protocols at all of our centers to protect patients, personnel, and the broader community.


Are you pre-screening patients for COVID-19 symptoms?
In our efforts to protect the community amidst the growing health concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a screening process for patients before entry, based on CDC guidelines. The screening interview questions will be used to make medically appropriate decisions regarding imaging services locations and urgency.


What are the COVID-19 guidelines for center visits?
Akumin has updated some of its processes to reduce the further spread of the coronavirus and to help keep our patients safe. To help you prepare for your appointment, please keep the following in mind.  Patients should try to arrive 15 minutes prior to their appointment time to answer pre-screening questions. All patients must wear a mask. Patients must enter the facility alone unless they are a minor or have a disability that requires assistance.
