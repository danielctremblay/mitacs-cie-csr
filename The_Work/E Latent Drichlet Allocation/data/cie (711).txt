Ghada tackles diabetes Earlier this month, a customer came in to see long-time pharmacist Ghada Gabr, who’s also associate owner of three Shoppers Drug Mart® locations in Halifax. His vision was blurry, he noticed he was thirsty all the time, and he was urinating way more than usual. He knew something was wrong, but he didn’t have a family doctor and wasn’t sure what to do. Luckily, Ghada did. Linda’s at 60 years and counting Staying with a company for 40 or 50 years is impressive, but Linda Vogelstatter went even further: she celebrated her 60th anniversary with Loblaw last January. Linda, now a cashier at a Loblaws® location in downtown Toronto, still remembers the exact date she started her journey with the company: January 10, 1961.  Christa sees the subtle signs of mental illness When her 13-year-old daughter, Nafisa, started spending more time in her room, sleeping more, and coming home from school exhausted, Pharmacy Operations Specialist Christa Wasko put it down to two normal causes: being a typical teenager, and pandemic fatigue. All of that changed this past winter when, what began as a stomachache one morning, turned into a month-long absence from school. Aaron’s home away from home Aaron Buitenwerf, a cashier at a Real Canadian Superstore® location in Grimsby, Ont., visited The Fort for the first time with his friend, Spencer, when he was 12 years old. The Fort is an after-school program and youth centre with a location in Smithville, Ont., and it was there that he found a community, a family, and a place to call home.
