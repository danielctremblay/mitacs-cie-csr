Improved customer service by using Lean process improvement techniques to streamline the Lead Rental Registry program. Prior to 2015, Property Owners with questions about compliance with the program were often put on hold for 20 minutes or more, there was a backlog of registry applications and renewals, and state employees were frustrated about constantly working from behind.The Department of the Environment treated this problem by using Lean management techniques to eliminate waste in the lead rental registry process and to organize their work. Using techniques like Lean 5S, the Department was able to eliminate the backlog, create an organized system for handling calls so that there are no more wait times, and employees are happier now that they have had the management of this program under sustainable control for over a year. 45 Calvert Street, Annapolis, MD 21401(410) 974-3901
