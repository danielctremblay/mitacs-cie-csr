Mountain Province DiamondsMountain Province Diamonds is a Canadian diamond company. In joint venture with De Beers, we oversee operations at the Gahcho Kué diamond mine located in the Northwest Territories of Canada. We are unique in the diamond industry that we market and sell our share of diamonds independently from our joint venture partner De Beers.
Our primary assets are a 49% interest in the Gahcho Kué Mine and our 100% owned Kennady North Project.





Our VisionMountain Province Diamonds brings together exploration, mining, and marketing of natural rough diamonds from Canada’s Northwest Territories. Our vision is to create long-term value for our business and to work with local communities to ensure we leave a lasting, positive legacy in the areas we operate. We preserve the heritage of our natural diamonds by independently marketing through select partners and offering diamonds of known provenance.
