A Lithium Project for a Sustainable Future, Situated in Québec, Canada
































Nemaska Lithium




Nemaska Lithium
Nemaska Lithium is a developing chemical company whose activities will be vertically integrated, from spodumene mining to the commercialization of high-purity lithium hydroxide. These lithium salts are mainly destined for the fast-growing lithium-ion battery market, which is driven by the increasing demand for electric vehicles and energy storage worldwide. With its products and processes, Nemaska Lithium intends to facilitate access to green energy, for the benefit of humanity.
The company intends to operate the Whabouchi mine in Québec, Canada, one of the richest lithium spodumene deposits in the world, both in volume and grade. The spodumene concentrate produced at the mine will be processed at the Shawinigan conversion plant using patented proprietary methods developed by the company.












Whabouchi Mine





Whabouchi Mine
The Whabouchi mine, a world-class spodumene deposit, is located in Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory, 30 kilometres from the Cree Community of Nemaska and 350 kilometres north of Chibougamau. In the first 24 years, production will be extracted from an open-pit lithium mine at a rate of 2,830 tonnes of mineral per day. In the final nine years, production will be extracted from an underground lithium mine at a rate of 3,665 tonnes per day.












Conversion Plant
