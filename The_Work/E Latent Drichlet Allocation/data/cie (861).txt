$45 billion
We have approximately $45 billion of assets under management, including Onex investing capital.



Our Platform Onex manages and invests capital on behalf of shareholders, institutional investors and high net worth clients from around the world. This capital is committed to or invested in Onex’ various platforms. Our private equity platforms, Onex Partners and ONCAP, seek to acquire and build high-quality businesses in partnership with talented management teams and focus on execution theses rather than macro-economic or industry trends.
Onex Credit manages primarily non-investment grade debt through tradeable, private and opportunistic strategies as well as actively managed public equity and public credit funds. We practice value-oriented investing, employing a bottom-up, fundamental and structural analysis of the underlying borrowers.
Gluskin Sheff, one of Canada’s pre-eminent wealth management firms, offers investment opportunities in Onex’ public and private strategies together with the highest level of personalized service to high net worth clients.




37 years
Founded in 1984



Our Team We are led by the firm’s founder and CEO, Gerry Schwartz, our president and head of Onex Partners, Bobby Le Blanc, and experienced leadership teams at each of our platforms.
Our 201 investment and wealth management professionals are each dedicated to a separate investment platform: Onex Partners, ONCAP, Onex Credit and Gluskin Sheff. These investment teams are supported by approximately 185 professionals dedicated to our corporate functions and investment platforms.




2.6x
Onex’ private equity investing has generated an average gross multiple of capital invested of 2.6 times and a 27% gross IRR on realized, substantially realized and publicly traded investments.



Our Track Record We manage and invest shareholder capital and that of investors from around the world, including public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and family offices. We have generated an average gross multiple of capital invested of 2.6 times and a 27% gross IRR from our private equity activities since inception on realized, substantially realized and publicly traded investments. Our credit platform is focused on generating strong risk-adjusted returns across market cycles.
