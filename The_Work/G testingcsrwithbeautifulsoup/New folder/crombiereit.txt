“As I look back on Crombie's progress over the past 11 years, I cannot help but be proud of how far we’ve come. In that time we have grown from a small Atlantic Canadian organization into a leading national REIT with assets of $4.6 billion and a significant development potential over the next 10 to 15 years. With the continued support of Crombie’s employees and investors, I am confident we will continue to be building a better REIT for many years to come.”
