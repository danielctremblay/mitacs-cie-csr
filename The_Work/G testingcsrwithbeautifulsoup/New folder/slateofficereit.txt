About Slate Office REIT
Two-thirds of office space inventory is often overlooked by large commercial real estate platforms, which are focused on “core” buildings in the biggest cities. At Slate, we see great value in this overlooked market, and we are building a leading office REIT to take advantage of this for investors. By buying at a discount to replacement cost with below market rents, we focus on the fundamentals. We use our expertise as market leaders and exceptional hands-on operators to actively manage the assets to create value for our unitholders.
