Why TransGlobe?










TransGlobe is principally focused on the development and exploitation of existing discovered resources and has a secondary focus on exploration.











TransGlobe seeks to provide returns to shareholders through capital appreciation and dividends.











TransGlobe has a business development office located in London, UK with an operating office in Cairo, Egypt and the corporate registered office in Calgary, Canada.











Our Strategy


TransGlobe's strategy is to identify and acquire overlooked and underdeveloped opportunities in the Middle East/North Africa region then apply proven technology and operating practices to extract additional value while maintaining a conservative approach to financing and cash management.
