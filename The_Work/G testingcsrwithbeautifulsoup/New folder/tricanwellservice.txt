Industrial Services
Industrial services provide solutions from the "wellhead to the gas pump" for refining, petrochemical, power generation, and gas processing facilities. With a focus on maintenance, inspection, cleaning and other support services, designing effective solutions depends on a thorough understanding of the processes and needs unique to a facility. This knowledge enables engineered programs for safe and economical operations.

Coiled Tubing
Coiled tubing uses a continuous length of steel pipe spooled onto a large diameter reel to quickly convey tools, and circulate liquids and gases into and out of a pressurized wellbore. The pipe comes in a variety of sizes and can be run into both shallow and deep wells. With sound technical analysis and experienced operational execution, coiled tubing provides effective solutions for optimized well performance.

Fracturing
Many formations are too tight to produce oil and natural gas without stimulation. Hydraulic fracturing helps extract these resources by pumping fluids carrying proppants and additives deep underground with enough pressure to crack the rock. The fluids flow back to the surface, while the proppant stays behind to hold open the cracks. This creates pathways for the oil and gas to flow, allowing for greater reservoir production.

Cementing
Cementing is one of the most important operations performed on a well. Without it, the well may never reach its full production potential, and liquids from one zone could interfere with or be lost to another. After drilling, steel pipe - called casing - is inserted into the well, and cement is pumped down the pipe and circulated up the annulus. This results in a strong barrier that isolates zones and protects aquifers, and supports the casing for safe and effective operations.

Acidizing and Production Enhancement
Acidizing and production enhancement operations increase or restore production in all types of wells. Treatments are categorized by injection rate and pumping pressure, and consist of many different blends of acids and solvents. The best solutions come from a thorough investigation of the formation, wellbore data and available wellbore samples. Understanding these variables enables fit-for-purpose treatments designed for maximized resource recovery.

Remote Well Monitoring
With horizontal multistage fracturing becoming more common, the potential for a loss of wellbore integrity due to inter-wellbore communication can be high. Remote monitoring solutions uses pressure transducers and remote station displays installed on offset wells within a certain distance from a fracture treatment. These stations allow you to monitor pressure changes that may indicate communication between the two wellbores for safe and effective operations.

Well Intervention Tools
Well intervention tools are used during and after the completion of a well to enhance or restore reservoir production. These specialized tools work in a variety of applications, including the stimulation of a targeted area or interval, as well as the removal of obstructions from the wellbore. With a wide array of options available, well intervention tools help you optimize reservoir production.

Geological Solutions
Knowledge is power when it comes to unlocking the true potential of a resource play. The key is in the rocks. Reservoirs hold valuable information, from how resources are stored to how the formation will respond to stimulation. Integrating geological, geochemical and geomechanical properties with expert analyses and advanced imaging techniques gives you the understanding you need to get the most from your well.

Multistage Fracturing Tools
Multistage fracturing tools allow multiple stages to be stimulated in a wellbore with a single continuous operation. These completion tool systems can be cemented or open hole, and use market-leading technology to provide innovative solutions to wellbore challenges. The wide variety of multistage fracturing tools available helps you get the most from your reservoir with increased operational efficiency.

Reservoir Solutions
Reservoir solutions help improve hydrocarbon recovery using analytical and numerical tools that link geology, reservoir engineering and treatment knowledge. By performing relevant tests before completing a wellbore; monitoring and analyzing well production; and using advanced reservoir simulation and modeling, reservoir solutions helps you to better understand your reservoir. The resulting knowledge helps you make more strategic decisions toward recovering your resources efficiently.
