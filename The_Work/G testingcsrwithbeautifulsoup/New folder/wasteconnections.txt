Types of Dumpster Rentals
Waste Connections offers a variety of dumpster rentals for any type of project or business need:




Roll-off Containers - make the job easier for yourself and your employees. Roll-off containers reduce your reliance on the landfill and keep worksite garbage hazards in one place.

Commercial Dumpsters - rent a commercial dumpster for your business and let Waste Connections do the garbage pickup. No matter your business size, we can find a commercial dumpster rental that is right for you. Commercial dumpsters cut down on the number of bins you’ll need, so collection and containment are more manageable.







Trash Compactors - for large businesses, shopping centers, apartment complexes, or businesses with bulky refuse. Trash compactors compress your waste, which reduces the number of garbage pickups, saving you money. Waste Connections rents, sells, and services commercial trash compactors for businesses.
