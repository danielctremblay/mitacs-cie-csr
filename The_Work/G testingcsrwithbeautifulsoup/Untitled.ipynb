These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, changes in the level of capital investment, success of business and operating initiatives and restructuring objectives, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the research and development pipeline of ADVANZ, customers’ strategies and stability, changes in the regulatory environment, fluctuations of interest and exchange rates, the outcome of litigation, government actions and natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes.

      "On February 2,  2021, Agnico Eagle acquired  TMAC Resources Inc., the operator of the Hope Bay property located in the  Kitikmeot region of Nunavut, Canada. The property and operations are remote but  not isolated, serviced by both a port and airstrip. Hope Bay is an 80 km by 20 km  Archean greenstone belt that has been explored by multiple companies  over a period spanning more than 30 years. TMAC began producing gold in early  2017 from Doris, its first mine at Hope Bay, and processed gold at the Doris  processing plant which originally had nameplate capacity of 1,000 tpd and  expanded to 2,000 tpd midway through 2018.\n",
      "In 2021, the  Company expects to continue mining at the Doris deposit while undertaking  optimization efforts. The Hope Bay mine is not included in the Company’s  production, cost or capital expenditure guidance for 2021, nor included in its  year-end 2020 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates.\n",
      "The Company  expects to spend $16.2 million in 2021 for 69,600 metres of drilling at the  Hope Bay property, including $5.5 million for 29,800 metres of delineation  drilling to support production at the Doris mine and $10.7 million for 39,800  metres of drilling on exploration targets around the Doris, Madrid and Boston  deposits and other targets along the belt. The Company is currently evaluating  exploration priorities and metres allocated on each program and may adjust the  allocation during the course of 2021.\n",

Several low-dose images from different angles around the breast are used to create the 3D picture. A 3D mammogram takes a few seconds longer than a 2D mammogram because more images are taken, but if you’ve had a mammogram in the past you won’t likely notice a difference. We encourage you to visit our Health Library to learn even more about breast imaging.                        \n",

The bones that are most commonly tested are in the spine, hip and sometimes the forearm. Your test result will help your healthcare provider make recommendations to help you protect your bones or treat the early signs of osteoporosis.                          \n",

      "\n",
      "                        Calcium scoring is the standard test to detect coronary artery calcification. CACS uses a Computed Tomography (CT) scan to find the buildup of calcium on the walls of the arteries of the heart. The test identifies your level of deposits and produces a calcium score. Normally, the coronary arteries do not contain calcium, therefore a finding of calcium in the coronary arteries is the earliest indicator of heart disease. Taking into account other factors such as age, family history and cholesterol level, your doctor uses this score to measure your potential for heart disease and to determine how severe it is. We encourage you to visit our Health Library to learn even more about Calcium Scoring.                        \n",

      "                        Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) uses a radioactive tracer to evaluate heart tissue functioning. It is a very accurate way to diagnose coronary artery disease and detect areas of low blood flow in the heart. A cardiac PET scan can help in determining if you’ll benefit from a cardiac procedure or surgery to restore blood flow. The tracers used for the scans can help identify injured but still living (viable) heart muscle that might be saved if blood flow is restored in time.                        \n",

      "                        An echocardiogram is an ultrasound scan of the heart. The scan can give accurate pictures of the heart muscle, the heart chambers, and structures within the heart. Abnormalities such as damaged heart valves, thickened heart muscle, and some congenital heart defects, can be seen quite clearly. The echoes are detected by a probe that the operator moves around over the skin’s surface to obtain views from different angles. The images are displayed as a picture on a monitor and the images are constantly updated so the scan can show movement as well as structure. Please visit our Health Library to learn about the different types of echocardiography tests your physician may order for you.                        \n",

      "                        An arthrogram is a two-part procedure used to obtain detailed pictures of the inside of a joint; commonly the shoulder, knee, hip, or wrist. After a contrast medium is injected by a needle into the joint, the radiographer obtains a series of MRI scans to help properly diagnose the cause of pain or restricted motion of a joint.                          \n",

Several low-dose images from different angles around the breast are used to create the 3D picture. A 3D mammogram takes a few seconds longer than a 2D mammogram because more images are taken, but if you’ve had a mammogram in the past you won’t likely notice a difference.

The bones that are most commonly tested are in the spine, hip and sometimes the forearm.

CACS uses a Computed Tomography (CT) scan to find the buildup of calcium on the walls of the arteries of the heart. The test identifies your level of deposits and produces a calcium score. Normally, the coronary arteries do not contain calcium, therefore a finding of calcium in the coronary arteries is the earliest indicator of heart disease. Taking into account other factors such as age, family history and cholesterol level, your doctor uses this score to measure your potential for heart disease and to determine how severe it is. We encourage you to visit our Health Library to learn even more about Calcium Scoring.                        \n",

It is a very accurate way to diagnose coronary artery disease and detect areas of low blood flow in the heart. A cardiac PET scan can help in determining if you’ll benefit from a cardiac procedure or surgery to restore blood flow. The tracers used for the scans can help identify injured but still living (viable) heart muscle that might be saved if blood flow is restored in time.                        \n",

Abnormalities such as damaged heart valves, thickened heart muscle, and some congenital heart defects, can be seen quite clearly. The echoes are detected by a probe that the operator moves around over the skin’s surface to obtain views from different angles. The images are displayed as a picture on a monitor and the images are constantly updated so the scan can show movement as well as structure.

      "Alexco Resource Corp. is a primary silver company that provides exceptional exposure and leverage to silver in one of the safest mining jurisdictions in the world. Alexco owns the majority and most prospective part of the Keno Hill Silver District, located in the Yukon Territory, Canada. Keno Hill is located within the traditional territory of the First Nation Na-Cho Nyak Dun and is one of the highest-grade silver districts in the world, having produced historically more than 214 Moz of silver at an average grade of approximately 1,373 g/t or 44 oz/t from the early 1900’s through the late 1980’s.\n",
      "In June 2020, following the receipt of the amended and renewed draft WUL from the Yukon Water Board, Alexco made a decision to advance Keno Hill to production. The Company is a proven explorer, developer, and mine operator and is fully financed for production.\n",
      "Alexco expects to start concentrate and silver sales in Q4 2020 and incrementally scale up to reach design-capacity in early 2021 per the Keno Hill PFS.\n",

      "1 Refer to news release dated March 28, 2019 entitled “Alexco Announces Positive Pre-Feasibility Study for Expanded Silver Production at Keno Hill Silver District\n",
      "2 AISC is a non-GAAP measure calculated on a produced (contained) basis net of by-products, as defined by the World Gold Council. Calculated using the following Average Prices: Ag US$ 17.91/oz, Au US$ 1,325/oz, Pb US$ 1.00/lb, Zn US$ 1.22/lb. and US$/CDN$ FX of $0.76.\n",
      "The Keno Hill PFS contemplates ore production of approximately 1.2 Mt at an average grade of approximately 805 g/t silver, 2.98% lead, and 1.13% zinc from four deposits (Bellekeno, Flame & Moth, Bermingham, and Lucky Queen) over an eight year period. The average processing rate during the eight year mine life is estimated to be 430 tpd and Keno Hill is expected to produce approximately 4 Moz of silver annually, contained in high-quality lead-silver and zinc concentrates.\n",
      "In 2019 and the first half of 2020, Alexco advanced construction of surface infrastructure at Keno Hill including the new Bermingham mine portal, upgrades to haul roads, workshops, construction of ore storage pads, and mill refurbishment. The Company is currently ramping up its operations workforce to start the final underground development necessary to reach the production areas of the Flame & Moth and Bermingham deposits. In addition, work continues to upgrade the existing mill, finalize the employee camp accommodations, administrative offices and ancillary facilities.\n",
      "Along with the production decision, in June 2020 the Company announced amendments to its silver streaming agreement with Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. wherein the production payment made by Wheaton to Alexco on the 25% silver stream will increase by approximately 70% in the first two years of silver production and more than 27% in the longer term.\n",
      "Without a doubt, Alexco’s exploration success has been the backbone of the Company’s success over the last ten years. Moving to production will not alter the Company’s exploration philosophy of systematic ranking and testing of near-surface silver targets across the 230 square km district; with only ~10% of the district having been explored in detail to date. Following a successful exploration program in 2019, which intersected high-grade mineralization below the known Bermingham deposit, also known as the “Bermingham Deep” target, and also discovered a new mineralized area, the Inca Vein, the Company plans to continue exploration in 2020 and beyond to unlock the significant geological and resource potential of the District. In July 2020, Alexco will commence an exploration program, which will be focused on the Bermingham Deep target. In addition, in March 2020 the Company extended the 2018 airborne geophysical survey across the upland parts of the District and generated data that will guide future brownfield exploration efforts in the District.\n",
      "Over the last ten years, Alexco has been rewarded with discovery and documentation of 30 Moz silver in Probable Mineral Reserves, 74 Moz silver in Indicated Mineral Resources (inclusive of Probable Mineral Reserves) and a further 24 Moz silver in Inferred Mineral Resources. Notably, in the last six years Alexco geologists have added more than 58 Moz silver in Indicated Mineral Resources to the Company’s Mineral Resource base at an average silver grade in excess of 800 g/t (26 oz/t) and a discovery cost of under $0.55 per ounce.\n",
      "The Company’s founders, Chief Executive Officer, Clynt Nauman, and President Brad Thrall, were named the recipients of the 2011 E.A. Scholz Award for Excellence in Mine Development due to the development of the Bellekeno mine, which took only three years from discovery to production, a feat rarely seen in the mining industry. This prestigious Association for Mineral Exploration (AME BC) award recognized them for their technical skills, environmental control expertise and cooperative relationship with the local First Nation of Na-Cho Nyak Dun.\n",
      "In 2018, Al McOnie, Seymour Iles and Jared Chipman won the 2018 H.H. “Spud” Huestis Award for Excellence in Prospecting and Mineral Exploration for the discovery and delineation of over 60 Moz silver in the Flame & Moth and Bermingham deposits.\n",
      "Alexco is committed to the responsible and sustainable development of Keno Hill. Our culture and values drive us to achieve excellence in all that we do, while supporting the communities and organizations in the areas in which we work.\n",

      "Abstract:Neuropathic pain is a major source of morbidity with an estimated 45 million people globally suffering from this condition. There are many causes of neuropathic pain and this condition has been treated with conventional analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents. First line therapeutic agents include anti-depressants and anti-convulsants and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)* . Yet many patients do not obtain relief from their pain. Opioids often become the mainstay of treating intractable neuropathic pain which can become problematic long-term. An overview of the use of cannabis in pain medicine and the its potential uses longterm will be discussed in this presentation.\n",

      "Abstract: Cannabinoids have been used as natural medicines for centuries; however, their biological activity in the skin is a new area of study. Recent data suggests that cannabinoids are involved in neuro-immuno-endocrine modulation of skin functioning. Specifically, cannabinoids have an inhibitory effect on skin inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis, pain, and itch, biological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of many dermatologic conditions. These mechanisms make cannabinoids attractive for conditions such as dermatitis, acne, localized scleroderma and due to their wound healing properties for management of orphan conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa.\n",

However, the sophistication of cannabis research has generated a flourishing shift in focus toward products comprised of whole-plant extracts and isolated phytochemicals. Notably, isolated cannabinoids have become a focal point within the market and have become recognized as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). This new wave of technological advancements has built a platform that is centred around the extraction of cannabinoid compounds to capture the unique pharmaceutical applications. This presentation will outline the multi-stage process of harvesting cannabis and will address the hurdles that surround the process of extraction and purification from the delicate trichomes of the plant into desirable APIs.\n",

      "Abstract: The ‘endocannabinoids’ arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are synthesised on demand and are rapidly inactivated by enzymes. There is ample evidence that the levels of endocannabinoids are increased in both physiological and pathophysiological situations, in which an autoprotective action of the endocannabinoids has been also implicated. Mammalian tissues express at least two types of cannabinoid receptor, CB 1 and CB 2 , both G protein coupled receptors (GPCR). Endocannabinoids interact with cannabinoid receptors and levels are elevated in response to certain triggers. For example, they are increased in response to nerve injury – reducing pain and inflammation; they are increased in response to stress to elevate mood. As such, the endocannabinoid system is a promising target for management of certain conditions including, for example, pain and inflammation. The primary constituents of cannabis (THC and CBD) interact with the endocannabinoid system in various ways; leading to potential therapeutic effects, but which may be accompanied by side- effects. The goal of current research is to assess the safety and efficacy of THC and CBD in a range ofillnesses; identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of their action.\n",

      "Abstract: Similar to more than 40% of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), cannabinoids have limited aqueous solubility, which creates challenges in formulation development and administration (e.g. oral, injectable, dermal routes). In order to improve the bioavailability and efficacy of these APIs for use in specific indications there is a need for well-designed drug formulations. The formulations must improve the solubility and stability of the API while resulting in sufficient bioavailability to yield the desired therapeutic effect and assure good safety and toxicity profiles. Attention must also be given to the scalability of the formulation to ensure translation from pre-clinical lab bench to industrial production. This seminar will provide an overview of the many considerations behind rational cannabinoid formulation design and strategies to ensure successful tech transfer to industrial scale development.\n",

      "Abstract: This is an exciting time for the medical cannabis industry with new medical cannabis products in late stage pre-clinical and clinical development, clinical product approvals and industry deals totaling billions of dollars. However, the two most studied cannabinoids, cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol, are beginning to be considered a cure-all for near to every minor ailment and chronic condition. Is this cause for concern? Another emerging critical question is whether or not scientific data and medical evidence support the current level of interest and investment in this area. This presentation addresses these questions and draws attention to the importance of recognizing that “legal and natural” are not equivalent to “safe and effective”. An overview of the historical use of medical cannabis with an emphasis on the latest groundbreaking developments will be provided. Medical cannabis formulations that are currently on the market will be reviewed with critical analysis of available clinical efficacy and safety data. Moreover, recommendations for pre-clinical and clinical studies will be provided with a goal towards the development of products that are safe and effective, and result in meaningful improvements in patient outcomes.\n",

      "The Badger Hydrovac™ –\n",
      "At Badger Daylighting™ we build our own custom and purpose built hydrovac trucks – ‘Badgers’ or ‘Badger Hydrovacs’ as they are popularly referred to. These vacuum trucks use integrated high-pressure water and vacuum systems mounted on a truck chassis to expose buried infrastructure or prepare an area for future work.\n",
      "Over the course of our 25 years in operation, the ‘Badger Hydrovac’ has gained a venerable reputation in the hydro-excavation category as it has consistently proven itself superior over traditional mechanical excavation. \n",
      "This has allowed Badger to grow into the largest hydrovac excavation fleet in North America. We have well over 1300 vacuum trucks (Badgers) and an extensive service coverage network strategically positioned throughout Canada and the USA.\n",

This is a reflection of variations in current industry practice. It is recommended that if the degree of commitment is not such that the accumulation is expected to be developed and placed on production within a reasonable timeframe, the estimated recoverable volumes for the accumulation be classified as contingent resources. Contingent Resources may include, for example, accumulations for which there is currently no viable market, or where commercial recovery is dependent on the development of new technology, or where evaluation of the accumulation is still at an early stage.\n",

While we look forward to a continuing, successful vaccine rollout and a return to normal life, our high occupancy rate and rent collections, strong balance sheet and robust credit metrics are serving us well and delivering strong and resilient results.  At the same time, we are committed to working with the small proportion of our tenants who need our support to get through the pandemic, and to supporting the communities in which we operate, while prudently growing our business.\n",

Through our unique relationship with CTC, our majority unit holder, we have a high degree of alignment and a comprehensive understanding of its real estate and long term planning. We also benefit from CTC’s insights into today’s continually evolving retail marketplace helping to shape our strategy and guide our plans.  These advantages, coupled with a conservative approach to financial management, allows for an attractive balance of growth and security, what we mean when we describe CT REIT as “Reliable, Durable, Growing\".\n",

      "Fortune Minerals Limited is a North American development stage mining company and past producer. Fortune is currently focused on advancing the vertically integrated NICO cobalt-gold-bismuth-copper project, comprised of a proposed mine and mill in the Northwest Territories that will produce a bulk concentrate for shipment to a refinery that the Company plans to construct in southern Canada. The products that will be produced at the refinery include cobalt chemicals used to make high performance rechargeable batteries, bismuth metals and chemicals, as well as gold. With all of its assets located in North America, Fortune is positioned to become a reliable producer of these products that are critical to a growing world economy and otherwise subject to supply chain risks from political and/or policy uncertainty and concentration of supply.  \n",
      "Fortune also owns the Sue-Dianne copper-silver-gold deposit and other exploration projects in the Northwest Territories, and maintains the right to repurchase the Arctos anthracite coal deposits in northwest British Columbia that were previously purchased by a British Columbia Crown corporation.\n",

      "Non-GAAP Information\n",
      "Golden Star also uses certain non-International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) financial measures as defined in applicable Canadian and United States securities laws (\"non-GAAP measures\"), including the terms “cash operating cost per ounce”, “all-in sustaining costs”, “cash generated from operations before working capital changes”, “adjusted net (loss)/income attributable to Golden Star shareholders and “adjusted net (loss)/income per share attributable to Golden Star shareholders”.  Golden Star believes that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies, but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance. In addition, changes in numerous factors including, but not limited to, Golden Star’s share price, risk free interest rates, gold prices, mining rates, milling rates, ore grade, gold recovery, costs of labor, consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease.\n",
      "Golden Star believes these measures are useful non-GAAP operating measures and supplement the IFRS disclosures made by the Company. These non-GAAP measures are not representative of all of Golden Star's cash expenditures and there are material limitations associated with the use of such non-GAAP measures. Since these non-GAAP measures do not incorporate all non-cash expense and income items, changes in working capital and non-operating cash costs, they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. \n",
      "The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, other data prepared in accordance with IFRS.  For an explanation of the Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company, please refer to the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in the Company’s Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Three Months ended March 31, 2014 and the Company’s Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2013, available at www.sedar.com.\n",
