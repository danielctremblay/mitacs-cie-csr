Find out how








Manage and secure your data, devices, and applications with an unbreakable connection to every endpoint — on or off your network.











Enable your remote workforce with confidence

Absolute gives you unparalleled line-of-sight to your devices and data. The self-healing connection keeps critical applications such as SCCM, VPN, antivirus, and encryption present, healthy, and up-to-date. And sensitive data remains protected, even when accessed from outside your network. 













































46% of VPN clients are misconfigured or out-of-date


!












































































































































60% of breaches are linked to an available patch not being applied


!














Remediate devices remotely and at scale

Maintain complete control of every endpoint, with a comprehensive library of automated, custom workflows — no scripting required. Reduce the load on your IT and security teams with pre-built commands for enforcing Windows updates, managing device configurations, and resolving issues — from helpdesk tickets to security events. 








Deploy easily and manage from anywhere

Absolute is the only endpoint security solution factory-installed by every major PC manufacturer. Embedded in the BIOS of over half a billion devices, chances are, you already have it. All you have to do is activate it. 















































































The industry benchmark for endpoint resilience

Trust Absolute to maintain compliance, manage secure device lifecycles, and safeguard your assets. If the agent is compromised – maliciously or through negligence – it heals automatically, ensuring a virtually unbreakable connection between the console and your devices. 

















IT Security Teams Love Absolute
Over 13,000 companies rely on Absolute to manage and secure their endpoint environments.
