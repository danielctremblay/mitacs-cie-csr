The Hope Bay property is located in the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut, approximately 685 km northeast of Yellowknife and 125 km southwest of Cambridge Bay.  It has over 90 regional exploration targets across an 80 km greenstone belt.







Overview

On February 2,  2021, Agnico Eagle acquired  TMAC Resources Inc., the operator of the Hope Bay property located in the  Kitikmeot region of Nunavut, Canada. The property and operations are remote but  not isolated, serviced by both a port and airstrip. Hope Bay is an 80 km by 20 km  Archean greenstone belt that has been explored by multiple companies  over a period spanning more than 30 years. TMAC began producing gold in early  2017 from Doris, its first mine at Hope Bay, and processed gold at the Doris  processing plant which originally had nameplate capacity of 1,000 tpd and  expanded to 2,000 tpd midway through 2018.
In 2021, the  Company expects to continue mining at the Doris deposit while undertaking  optimization efforts. The Hope Bay mine is not included in the Company’s  production, cost or capital expenditure guidance for 2021, nor included in its  year-end 2020 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates.
The Company  expects to spend $16.2 million in 2021 for 69,600 metres of drilling at the  Hope Bay property, including $5.5 million for 29,800 metres of delineation  drilling to support production at the Doris mine and $10.7 million for 39,800  metres of drilling on exploration targets around the Doris, Madrid and Boston  deposits and other targets along the belt. The Company is currently evaluating  exploration priorities and metres allocated on each program and may adjust the  allocation during the course of 2021.
