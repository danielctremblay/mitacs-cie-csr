Bell Let’s Talk
Leading the way in Canadian mental health
The Bell Let’s Talk mental health initiative launched in 2010 with a focus on building awareness and action in Canadian mental health, reducing the stigma around mental illness while improving access to care, research and workplace mental health. Since then, Canadians and people worldwide have taken the mental health conversation to remarkable heights each year, driving unprecedented change in mental health.
In March 2020, Bell announced the extension of Bell Let’s Talk for a further 5 years and an increase in Bell’s total funding commitment for Canadian mental health to at least $155 million through 2025. The announcement included a commitment to accelerate the transformation  of services for young people and support national collaboration to improve youth mental health services through Integrated Youth Services hubs.
Bell Let’s Talk is making a difference  through partnerships with more than 1,100 health care and research  institutions, governments and community groups throughout the country. We’re  also raising the bar in workplace mental health, leading by example through the  support and adoption of National  Standard of Canada for Psychological  Health and Safety in the Workplace, innovative training and development  programs, and enhanced resources and employee benefits.
