      Sustainability is not an option. It's standard.

             The DIRTTy Truth    A $100/square foot budget looks very different when you’re paying for the labor and hidden costs of a longer schedule.

The percentage of each hour you’re paying people to wait and move materials around site is:    DIRTT 27 %    Conventional 68%    Ok that's pretty convincing. What else?
