WELCOME TO MINCO SILVER CORPORATION
MINCO Silver Corporation. (TSX:MSV,  QX:MISVF, WKN:AOESX5) is a Canadian-based silver mining company focused on the acquisition and development of high quality silver properties.   Since start-up in December of 2005, Minco Silver has focused on the Fuwan Silver project, and seeks to acquire quality projects to diversify its property portfolio. 

The Fuwan Silver Project is situated approximately 45 km southwest of Guangzhou City, the capital of Guangdong Province, and the fourth largest city in China with a population of 13 million people.

The Fuwan Silver Project may be considered exceptional, from a development perspective, due to its proximity to well-developed infrastructure, as the property enjoys immediate access to road, water, rail, and a variety of services including skilled and unskilled labour, allowing the Company to advance the project at much lower capital costs as compared to similar-sized projects globally. To date, the Company has only explored approximately 2.8 km of the 10 km strike length.
