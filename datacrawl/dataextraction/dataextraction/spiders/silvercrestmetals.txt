SilverCrest Metals Inc. is a Canadian precious metals exploration company headquartered in Vancouver, BC, that is focused on new discoveries, value-added acquisitions and targeting production in Mexico’s historic precious metal districts. SilverCrest is the first company to drill test the historic, high grade Las Chispas Silver-Gold project, which is a past precious metals producer. The Company is led by a proven management team in all aspects of the precious metal mining sector, including experience and success in applying a responsible “phased approach” business model in taking projects from discovery, finance, on time and on budget construction, and production with subsequent increased value to shareholders.

* The Company cautions that the results of the PEA are preliminary in nature and include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic consideration applied to them to be classified as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the results of the PEA will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.
