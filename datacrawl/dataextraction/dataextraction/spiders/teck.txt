Enabling Technology
Copper is an essential part of people’s lives. Today, copper is the material of choice for powering our modern world as a vital component in everything from power generation and hybrid vehicles to computers and smartphones.

Read More













Powering the World
Energy is essential to our lives. We all rely on energy—to keep the lights on, to get to work, or to heat or cool our homes. As populations around the globe — particularly in developing nations — grow and become increasingly urbanized, the demand for energy is increasing.

Read More













Saving Lives
Zinc protects steel by improving its durability. The primary uses of zinc are for galvanizing steel to protect against weather and corrosion, producing brass and bronze, and in die-casting to produce a wide range of metal products. When added to fertilizers, zinc can increase crop yields and crop quality. And, as an essential nutrient in human development and disease prevention, zinc saves lives.

Read More













Building Infrastructure
Steelmaking coal is an essential ingredient in the production of steel. Also called metallurgical or coking coal, it is a necessary ingredient in producing steel for building infrastructure such as rail, bridges and schools improving the quality of life for people around the world. Steel and steelmaking coal are required for everything from clean energy projects like wind or solar power to transportation like rapid transit, buses and vehicles.
