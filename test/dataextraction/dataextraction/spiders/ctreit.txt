A Message from CEO, CT REIT, Ken Silver
As all of us continue to deal with the implications of the global pandemic, CT REIT remains focused on the health and well-being of our employees, our tenants and their customers and employees. While we look forward to a continuing, successful vaccine rollout and a return to normal life, our high occupancy rate and rent collections, strong balance sheet and robust credit metrics are serving us well and delivering strong and resilient results.  At the same time, we are committed to working with the small proportion of our tenants who need our support to get through the pandemic, and to supporting the communities in which we operate, while prudently growing our business.
