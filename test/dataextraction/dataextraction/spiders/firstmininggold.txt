First Mining is a Canadian gold developer focused on the development and permitting of the Springpole Gold Project in northwestern Ontario. Springpole is one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in Canada. The results of a positive Pre-Feasibility Study for the Springpole Gold Project were announced by First Mining in January 2021, and permitting activities are ongoing leading to the submission of an Environmental Impact Statement as outlined in detail on our Environmental Assessment portal. The Company also has a number of active partnerships including the Goliath Gold Complex (Treasury Metals); Pickle Crow (Auteco  Minerals); and Hope Brook ( Big Ridge Gold), in addition to wholly owned properties, Cameron,  Duparquet, Duquesne and Pitt.
First Mining was established in 2015 by Mr. Keith Neumeyer, founding President and CEO of First Majestic Silver Corp.
