About Torex Gold

Torex Gold is a leading Canadian intermediate gold producer engaged in mining, developing and exploring our 29,000 hectare Morelos Gold Property in the highly prospective Guerrero Gold Belt in Mexico.
We are currently Mexico’s second-largest gold producer, delivering consistent and reliable production and strong cash flow. As we look to the future and continue to realize the full potential of the Morelos Gold Property, we are also seeking opportunities to acquire assets that enable profitable and productive geographic diversification.
At the heart of Torex is a deep commitment to building a mining company with values – one that delivers value for our shareholders in a way that embraces innovation and makes a positive difference in people’s lives. We invite you to learn more about us, our operations, and our exciting plans for the future.
