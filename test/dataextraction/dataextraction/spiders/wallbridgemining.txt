Q&A With our CEO

Q1 2020 UPDATE
Watch Now










Wallbridge Mining Company Limited (Wallbridge) is an advanced exploration-development company driven by a strategic targeted approach. 
The Company is focused on advancing the development of its flagship high-grade Fenelon Gold Project in northern Québec. Since acquiring the project in 2016, Wallbridge has demonstrated the project’s potential to host a multi-million-ounce gold deposit.  Following success at the drill bit, the Company’s first mineral resource estimate is expected by Q3.
Wallbridge has expanded its Fenelon Gold project with the strategic acquisition of Balmoral Resources Ltd. and now controls a district-scale land position along the Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend, a major structure that hosts the Detour Lake gold mine to the west in Ontario.  Wallbridge has a strong pipeline of exploration projects to drive long-term organic growth to meet its objective of becoming a gold producer.
In addition, Wallbridge, mainly through a number of over-arching joint ventures, has an interest in a large portfolio of nickel-copper-PGM projects in Ontario's Sudbury Basin.
